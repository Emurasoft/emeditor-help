## Warning Against Unauthorized Usage - crack, keygen, serial, etc.

This is an important notice for all EmEditor users in order to protect our products from users who have illegally obtained and used registration keys.

It is prohibited for software users to possess unauthorized registration keys, obtained from anyone or any websites providing illegal serial numbers through crackers or Keygen groups. This is absolutely a violation of international and United States
copyright laws. We, Emurasoft, Inc., only provide valid registration keys for customers who complete the registration and purchase processes. However, we have noticed that invalid serial numbers have been increasingly generated by crackers and Keygen
groups and distributed to a wide range of areas all over the world.

In order to insist on justice and heighten our productivity as a vendor and developer, we are vehemently against all those who have provided any sources supporting illegal applications and those who have abused our products. Sharing software
registration keys with others is also prohibited.

Every user must have his/her own registration key acquired from the organizations authorized by Emurasoft, Inc.

Moreover, employing unregistered serial numbers could cause dangers and problems that are not easily remedied. No invalid license holders should be supported if they have any viruses on their computers or serious issues on privacy. For instance,
Trojan or other viruses might invade your computer if you obtain a registration key from a cracker or Keygen group. Not only could it destroy your crucial files, but it could also infect your computer. This action would cause injury to yourself and
others due to improper applications. We have determined our original instructions and policies on the product usage in order for users to enjoy our products. Therefore we highly recommend all EmEditor users to consider what we have pointed out in
this notice, and ask all users to purchase valid registration keys.
