# Optimized to Open Large Files

EmEditor allows you to easily open huge files - up to 16 TB or 1,099 billion lines - with only a little memory. EmEditor optimizes the speed to open a huge file, so it can open a huge file very quickly, even more so than previous
versions. The multithreaded design allows you to view documents during the opening of a file. A status window appears during the most time-consuming activities such as text editing, saving, searching, replacing, inserting and deleting, which allows
you to cancel those activities at any time. Even with smaller files, EmEditor improves the overall speed in most everyday activities such as file opening, editing, and saving, as well as text searching and replacing.
