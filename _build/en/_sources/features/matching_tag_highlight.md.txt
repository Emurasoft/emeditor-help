# Matching Tag Highlight

The new version automatically highlights inside a tag and the matching tag at
the cursor in XHTML and XML documents. This new feature makes it easy to read
documents and find matching tags. This feature will work only when a document is
a well-formed XML document. The feature may not work if ending tags are missing
from a document such as an old HTML document. In order for this feature to work,
the **Highlight Matching Tag** check box in the **Highlight**
**(2)** tab of configuration properties must be set.

Moreover, the **Find Matching Tag** and **Matching Tag**
**Extend** commands were added to jump conveniently between a tag and the
matching tag. By default, CTRL + . and CTRL + SHIFT + . are assigned as default
shortcut keys.
