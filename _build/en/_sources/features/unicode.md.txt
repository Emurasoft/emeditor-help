# Unicode Support

EmEditor supports Unicode, which is the preferred encoding method for
multiple language support. Not only can you open Unicode files but you can also edit
files as Unicode, therefore you can display multiple languages at the same time.

EmEditor supports _Unicode big endian, UTF-8, UTF-7, Baltic,_
_Central European, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Cyrillic, Greek,_
_Japanese (Shift-JIS), Japanese (JIS), Japanese (EUC), Korean, Thai, Turkish,_
_Vietnamese, Western European_, and all other encodings available in Windows.

## Notes:

EmEditor does NOT support languages that use right-to-left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew.
