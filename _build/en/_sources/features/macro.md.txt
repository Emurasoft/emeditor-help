# Powerful, functionally-rich macros

**With EmEditor Professional**, you can create functionally-rich
macros using **JavaScript** or **VBScript**, allowing you to define most
operations. Not only you can define a macro which records keystrokes that you
use and reference repeatedly, but you can also write your own macros which can
manipulate other applications, Windows files, or network functionalities. The
macros are based on the Windows Scripting Host (WSH) engine, so you can use all
of the powerful, robust objects available under the WSH.
