# CSV, TSV and DSV

When a CSV (Comma-separated), TSV (Tab-separated) or DSV (User-defined delimiter-separated) file is opened, all the separators line up vertically. You can select vertically a specified column, or sort values at a specified column. In conjunction with the narrowing mode, you can sort only selected
lines.
