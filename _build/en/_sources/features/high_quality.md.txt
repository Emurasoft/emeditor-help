# Highest Quality Features

While EmEditor is a small, fast text editor, its reliability and
capabilities are of the highest quality. On a Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7/8 system,
EmEditor is capable of opening files over 4 gigabytes in size (and depending on available memory,
theoretically up to 500 gigabytes).Â  It can open files with more than 10
million lines and 10 million columns of text or code. Undo and Redo counts are infinitely adjustable. Other
useful functions include wrap/no wrap, auto save, and backup. EmEditor's text
editing features offer the best alternative to Notepad.
