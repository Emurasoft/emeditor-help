# Q. How can I paste Japanese (or Korean, Chinese, etc.) Word documents into EmEditor and save as text files?

If Windows does not display
Japanese, Korean, or Chinese fonts properly, you will need to go to **Control**
**Panel**, select **Regional and Language Options**, click the **Languages**
tab, and then check **Install files for East Asian languages**.

Open your Word document, select the text
you want to copy, and then press CTRL + C to copy the text to the Clipboard.

Launch a new EmEditor window and press CTRL + V to paste the Clipboard contents to the EmEditor window. You should see the text in Japanese (or Korean,
Chinese, etc.). If you cannot see the text properly, select Japanese (or Korean,
Chinese, etc.) from the **Font Category** sub menu under the **View**
menu. If you still cannot see it properly, select the
[**Font** command](../../cmd/view/font)
under the **View** menu, and select an appropriate font, for instance, **MS**
**Gothic** if it is Japanese.

To save the document, select the [**Save As** command](../../cmd/file/file_save_as) under the **File**
menu, and make sure you select either **Unicode** or **UTF-8** from the **Encoding** drop-down list box. You may also select a locale-specific encoding such as
**Japanese (Shift-JIS)** if you wish.
