# Q. How can I erase all the previous words in the Find box?

Click **Clear History Now** in the bottom of the **Customize** dialog box, by choosing **Customize** under the **Tools** menu. If you want to delete only a certain item from the search history, select the item you want to delete in the **Find** drop-down list, then press ALT + DELETE.
