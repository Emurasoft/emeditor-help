# Q. I am using a previous version of EmEditor. Can I install a newer version of EmEditor without uninstalling the previous version?

If you have been using a version of EmEditor v3.00 or newer, and want to maintain the same configurations,
you do not need to uninstall the previous version. You can install the newest version with the same destination folder.
The steps are as follows:

1. Install the newest version.
2. When the installation is complete, reboot Windows.

If you have been using a version of EmEditor older than v3.00, or don't want to maintain the same configurations
of EmEditor, we recommend uninstalling the previous version completely and rebooting the computer
before installing the newer version of EmEditor. The steps are as follows:

1. Click the **Start** button and select Control Panel from the **Start** menu. Select the EmEditor (or EmEditor
v3) from the **Add or Remove Programs**. Click the **Delete** button.
2. Reboot Windows when uninstalling is complete.
3. Install the new version.
