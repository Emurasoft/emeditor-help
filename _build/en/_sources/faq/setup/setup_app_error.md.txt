# Q. What do I do if EmEditor crashes when starting or editing?

1. If you have plug-ins installed, remove all plug-ins from the
plug-ins folder, and try running EmEditor again.
2. If the problem persists, select **Add/Remove Programs** in Control Panel to
uninstall EmEditor. Reboot your PC, and reinstall EmEditor.

3. If EmEditor crashes only when opening UTF-8 or Unicode files, select **Font**
under the **View** menu, select **Normal** from the Character set list, select the
**Change** button beside the **Display Font** box and check if the proper font is
selected.
