# Q. Can I insert control characters such as form feeds?

To insert control characters on EmEditor v3, select **Advanced** \> **Insert**
**Special Characters** under the **Edit** menu. Alternatively, you can type
corresponding keys with CTRL (+ SHIFT) only if the corresponding keys have not
been assigned for shortcut keys and if the **Allow Insert Control Characters** is
checked on the **General** tab of **Properties**.
