# Version 14.5

June 25, 2014

## New General Features

- The **Synchronize Outline Bar and Outline Guide** command.
This will synchronize the expand/collapse status of both the Outline Bar and
the Outline Guide.
- Even when EmEditor is operated under the CSV/TSV mode or the outlining
mode, the
cursor position and selection will not be altered so that the overall
behavior will be more accurate.
- The
expand/collapse status of the outline guide and the outline bar tree will be
retained when you switch documents, drag and drop the items on the outline
bar tree, drag and drop the selected text to move or copy.
- Further optimized code allows smaller executables despite of improved
features.
- Improved the response time after cancelling when searching in very large
files.
- The improved Update Checker allows less clicks to update EmEditor to future versions.

## New Options

- The **Max level** and **Initially** drop-down
list boxes were added to the [**Outline** page](../dlg/properties/outline/index) of configuration properties.
- The [**Outline** page](../dlg/properties/outline/index) of configuration properties
now allows you to define up to 32 levels for the outlining.
- The **Synchronize selection to cursor position** check box was
deprecated in the [**Outline** page](../dlg/customize/outline/index) of the Customize dialog box.
- The **Jump to the first invalid character** check box was added to the dialog box which is displayed when an invalid character was encountered when opening a file.
