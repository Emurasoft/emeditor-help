# Version 16.9

June 6, 2017

## New General Features

- Greatly improved speed for the **Remove Newline Characters** command and **Replace All** (when the find string contains newline characters and the replace string does not) operations. See the test results table below.

### Test results:

|  | v16.5 | v16.6 | v16.9 | Comparison to v16.5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Replace All "9\\n" with "a" | 32.7 seconds | 22.4 seconds | 0.17 seconds | 192 times faster |
| Undo the above | 73.5 seconds | 29.2 seconds | 27.8 seconds | 2.64 times faster |
| Remove Newline Characters | 34.8 seconds | 22.4 seconds | 0.12 seconds | 290 times faster |
| Undo the above | 105.3 seconds | 13.9 seconds | 6.95 seconds | 15.2 times faster |
| Replace All "0123456789\\n" with "" (blank) | 13.8 seconds | 12.4 seconds | 0.078 seconds | 177 times faster |
| Undo the above | 7.7 seconds | 0.09 seconds | 0.078 seconds | 99 times faster |

\\* All test conditions are the same as [Version 16.6](v16_6).

- Greatly improved the speed of the **Advanced Filter** by selecting the new **Match Whole String** check box when many filters are defined.

### Test results:

|  | v16.8 | v16.9 (Match Whole String selected) | Comparison |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Advanced Filter, Match Case deselected | 115 seconds | 0.10 seconds | 1,150 times faster |
| Advanced Filter, Match Case selected | 123 seconds | 0.06 seconds | 2,050 times faster |

- **IPv4** and **IPv6** addresses are clickable now, and clicking IPv4/IPv6 addresses will display a web browser and show the IP information. Moreover, hovering over IPv4 addresses will display the country name as a tooltip where the IPv4 address was registered (In order to use this feature, you will need to download an additional file. See Remarks below.) The behaviors are customizable by editing the macro file.
- **Hexadecimal colors** and **RGB colors** can be clicked to show the **Color Picker** and allows you to select and change the color value.
- The behaviors of **Active Strings** (including URLs, email addresses, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, strings enclosed by quotation marks, HTML Character Reference, Universal Character Names/Percent-encoding, Hexadecimal colors, and RGB colors) can be customized to run macros, external tools, or EmEditor commands, in addition to previous behaviors.
- The **Link** page of configuration properties allows you to specify which strings act as **Active String**. The new **Active String** page of the **Customize** dialog box allows you to specify a behavior for each event such as **Left Click**, **Left Double-click**, **Middle Click**, and **Right Click** of each **Active String**.

## New Options

- The **Match Whole String** check box was added to the [**Advanced Filter** dialog box](../dlg/advanced_filter/index).

- The [**Active String** page](../dlg/customize/active_string/index) was added to the **Customize** dialog box.
- The **Add Additional Information to the Undo/Redo History** check box was added to the [**History** page](../dlg/customize/history/index) of the **Customize** dialog box.
- The **Remove the first line from all documents except the first document** check box was added to the [**Combine Files** wizard](../dlg/combine_files/combine_wiz_dest).

## Plug-in API New Features

- Added [**TIP\_INFO**](../plugin/structure/tip_info) and [**ACTIVE\_STRING\_INFO**](../plugin/structure/active_string_info) structures.
- Added **EEID\_FILTER\_COLUMN** and **EEID\_CUSTOMIZE\_ACTIVE\_STRING** commands.

## Macro New Features

- Added the [**ShowTip** method](../macro/window/show_tip) to the [**Window** object](../macro/window/index).
- Added the [**ActiveString** property](../macro/document/active_string) to the [**Document** object](../macro/document/index).

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed the bug where the **Multiline** option was not saved in the **Find** dialog box.
- Fixed a certain bug related to **Find in Files**.
- Fixed the bug where the **Backup Folder** was not saved in the **Replace in Files** dialog box.

## Remarks

In order to inspect the name of the country where the IP address is registered, download the [GeoLite2 Country database](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/), unzip and place the extracted CSV file in:

- If an EmEditor installer was used to install EmEditor (using the Registry):

%PROGRAMDATA%\\Emurasoft\\EmEditor\\data, i.e. **_C:\\ProgramData\\Emurasoft\\EmEditor\\data_**
- If a portable version of EmEditor is used (using INI files):

" _data_" subfolder of the EmEditor installed folder, i.e. **_X:\\...\\EmEditor\\data_**

It is recommended to download and update the above file periodically since the database is updated frequently.
