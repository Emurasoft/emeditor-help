# Version 15.8

February 15, 2016

## New General Features

- The **Cell Selection Mode** was added, and CSV editing was greatly enhanced. If the **Cell Selection Mode** was selected after a CSV document is opened, the CSV delimiters will be hidden, and you can **select cell(s) by the mouse or keyboard** like a spreadsheet program (Excel). During the Cell Selection Mode, pressing the **RIGHT** or **LEFT key** moves the cell right or left. Double-clicking on a cell, pressing the ENTER key, or selecting the **Edit Cell** command will allow you to edit the selected cell. Selecting the **Edit Cell** while selecting multiple cells will allow you to edit multiple cells simultaneously. Syntax check after a cell is edited and confirmed.
- In the **Cell Selection Mode**, **TAB** moves to the next cell, **SHIFT + TAB** moves to the previous cell. These commands as well as **Open Line Above** and **Open Line Below** commands insert delimiters automatically if not already exist.
- The Balloon Tip on Cell Selection Button on the CSV/Sort toolbar was added by default.
- **Cut Line(s)**, **Copy Line(s)**, and **Delete Line(s)** commands can now work when several lines are selected.
- Right-click menu on the left edge of the editor or on line numbers now includes **Cut Line(s)**, **Copy Line(s)**, **Paste**, and **Delete Line(s)** commands.
- Right-click on the My Macros on the Macros menu brings up the context menu including the **Edit** command.
- Previously used **SHA-1 digital signatures** were replaced by new **SHA-1/SHA-256 double digital signatures**.
- For security improvements, EmEditor no longer uses the **shared section** in the executable files.
- For security improvements, **address space layout randomization** ( **ASLR**) was enabled.

## New Options

- The **Switch to Cell Selection Mode Automatically** check box and the **Show Balloon Tip on Cell Selection Button** check box were added to the [**CSV page**](../dlg/customize/csv/index) of the **Customize dialog box**.
- **CSV cell selected text** and **CSV cell selection frame** were added to the list in the **Display** tab of configuration properties. **Thick Line** was added to the **Style** drop-down list.
- The **New** button to add a new item to the **My Macros** list was changed to the **Add** button on the **My Macro** tab of the **Customize Macros** dialog box.
