- [**Improved Markers**](../features/improved_markers)
- [**Messaging (Plug in)**](../features/messaging_plugin)
- **Optimization** \- When launching EmEditor, the new version doesn't scan My Macro files for #icon and #title anymore. This allows much faster launching of EmEditor. If these #icon and #title lines are modified before EmEditor launches, you will have to select **Refresh** on the right-click menu of **My Macros** toolbar.
- **Windows 8 Support** \- This version is designed for and compatible with Windows 8. Touch Input and Flicks are supported including scroll, cut, copy, paste, delete, undo, redo, back, forward, print, save, and others when Touch Input is available. Menus appear left when right-handed Tablet PC settings are used. Moreover, Toast displays incoming messages on Windows 8 when EmEditor receives messages from another PC. This allows viewing incoming messages even when a Metro app is
the foreground window.
- **Explorer context menu** is now supported on 64-bit Windows with 32-bit EmEditor.
- Pressing F3 or Shift + F3 while the **Find** dialog is open and focused now will function as same as pressing the **Find Down** or **Find Up** button.

- The **Batch Replace** dialog can export as JavaScript or VBScript files now.
- **onenote://** is hyperlinked now.
- The **Character Code Value** command now shows the Unicode surrogate values in addition to the Unicode value. For example, U+10000 now displays as:

U+10000

U+D800 U+DC00
- **Back** and **Forward** toolbar buttons were added.
- The new **search drop-down list box** was added to the toolbar of the Keymap window.
- On the **Keyboard** tab of configuration properties, the new **>** and **<** buttons were added to jump to the currently assigned command and back to the previous commands in the history.
- When the **Preserve CR/LF Returns on the Clipboard** is checked, vertical selection paste from a CSV document will now preserve returns under a certain condition.
- The vertical selection paste behavior was changed when lines are wrapped.

- The **Cut** (Ctrl+X), **Copy** (Ctrl+C), and **Paste** (Ctrl+V) commands were added to the **Snippets** plug-in. These commands can be used to copy or move snippets items easily around the snippet tree. The **Paste** command can be also used to insert a simple text snippet to the snippet tree.
- The Snippets text is now displayed as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over an item on the Snippets tree (Context menu - **View** \- **Tooltip** must be checked in order to enable this feature).

### Projects plug-in
