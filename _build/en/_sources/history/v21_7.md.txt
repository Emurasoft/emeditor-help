# Version 21.7

May 11, 2022

## New General Features

- The new version displays file comparison results in one vertically split window by default when you select the **[Compare](../cmd/diff/compare_direct)** or **[Compare with Options](../cmd/diff/compare_options)** command. The previously used tiled window display is still possible by setting options.
- The new version will keep the scroll position bottom when the file is reloaded if the scroll position was bottom before reloaded.
- When the **Detect All** option is set in the **File** page of configuration properties, the detected encoding was unsupported on Windows (such as **VISCII**), the new version will continue to open the file as the system default encoding and show a notification.
- Improved URI highlighting.
- Improved line selections in CSV selection mode.
- Changed the default style of **Horizontal Grid** from **Dotted Lines** to **Normal**, and optimized the drawing speed for **Vertical Separators**.
- Changed the default value for the **End Indent** in a regular expression in some configurations including C++.
- Supported **Bulk Replace All** in the **Batch Replace** dialog box. **Bulk Replace All** searches the document simultaneously for all search strings while **Batch Replace All** searches the document for one search string at a time and repeats the search for each search term. **Bulk Replace All** works much faster than **Batch Replace All**. See [**Difference between Batch Replace All and Bulk Replace All**](../howto/search/batch_vs_bulk) for more information.
