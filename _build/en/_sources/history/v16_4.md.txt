# Version 16.4

January 24, 2017

## New General Features

- The new **Auto Copy** feature allows you to copy the selection automatically to the Clipboard without selecting the Copy command (CTRL + C). While the **Auto Copy** mode is on, the selection will be copied to the Clipboard immediately before the selection is deselected or deleted, immediately before the active document is switched, or the editor loses the keyboard focus. However, it does not work during the CSV cell mode.
- The **Delete/Bookmark Duplicate Lines (Advanced)** command and **Sort by Multiple Columns** commands can be recorded as a macro now.
- When deleting duplicates of an already sorted document, setting the **Compare Adjacent Lines Only (Assume Presorted)** check box dramatically increases the speed of the operation.

## New Macros

- **AutoCopy.jsee** (Toggles the Auto Copy feature, equivalent to the Auto Copy command)
- Icons were added to all the standard macros.

## New Options

- The **Auto Copy** check box was added to the [**Edit** page](../dlg/customize/edit/index) of the **Customize** dialog box.
- The **Compare Adjacent Lines Only (Assume Presorted)** and **In the Selection Only** check boxes were added to the [**Delete/Bookmark Duplicate Lines** dialog box](../dlg/delete_duplicate_advanced/index).
- The **In the Selection Only** check box was added to the [**Sort by Multiple Columns** dialog box](../dlg/sort_multi/index).
- The **Show Arrows** check box was added to the [**Scroll** page](../dlg/properties/scroll/index) of configuration properties.
- The **Customize Macros** dialog box can be resizable now. The **My Macros** list in the **My Macros** tab now allows you to select multiple items, and it also allows you to drag and drop selected items. The **Top**, **Bottom**, and **Reset** buttons were added to the **My Macros** tab, and **Delete All** button is obsolete. While the **My Macros** list has the keyboard focus, **CTRL + A** allows you to select all items.
