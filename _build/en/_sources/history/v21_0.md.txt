# Version 21.0

August 10, 2021

## New General Features

- Added the **Layout** command (multiple items), and allows you to select which UI elements to show or hide, whether to switch to the full screen mode, and whether to retain the layout next time you launch EmEditor. By default, the **Full Screen** (F11) and **Focus Mode** (Alt+F11) **Screen** layouts were defined.
- Added the **/layout** switch to the [Command Line Options](../howto/file/file_commandline).
- Increased selecting, scrolling, and regular expression search speeds when a very long line exists in a file.
- The new version adds the command name as a comment to each **editor.ExecuteCommandByID** method when saving/editing a recorded macro.
