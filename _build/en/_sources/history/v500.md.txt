# Version 5.00

December 20, 2005

- EmEditor now runs in one process even when multiple files are open and no matter whether the tab is used. This allows EmEditor to start much faster when multiple files are selected to open, reduces
memory usage, and suppresses the task bar blinking when activating other documents. Multiple windows now run as multi-threading. The previous behavior (multi-process) is also possible by selecting
the
**Do not share process between documents (disables tabs)** check box in the
[**Advanced** page](../dlg/customize/advanced/index) of the
[**Customize** dialog box](../dlg/customize/index).
- Should an application error occur in EmEditor, the error handler will now let you save modified files before it actually terminates.
- Should an application error occur inside a plug-in, EmEditor will allow you to disable the plug-in without terminating.
- The tab style can now be selected between buttons and tabs.
- The Close button was added to the right side of the tab to close each document.
- Windows Grouping is now supported. To separate a document from the current group, drag and drop a tab toward outside of the current window, or select the [**New Group** command](../cmd/window/new_group).
- The tab icons can now be selected among None, File Types, and the EmEditor Icon.
- The tab width can now be selected among Adjust to file name, Truncate only when longer than specified width, and Fix to specified width.
- When the tabs don't fit in the window, the tab width can be now adjusted, or more rows can be added.
- Commands to execute by double-clicking and middle-clicking on the tab can be now customized.
- Rotating the mouse wheel on the tabs can now select the next or previous tab.
- The context menu on tabs can be now customized.
