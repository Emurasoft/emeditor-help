# Integrated Development Environment for Macros

When you open a macro file in EmEditor, keywords, such as EmEditor macro
objects, properties, or methods, are automatically highlighted. For assistance
on certain keywords, move the cursor over the keyword and select **Find**
**Keyword**, or press **F1**.

When an error occurs
during the execution of a macro, a dialog box will appear showing the content of
the error. If you click on the **Edit** button, the macro file opens,
allowing you to jump to the location where the error occurred.
