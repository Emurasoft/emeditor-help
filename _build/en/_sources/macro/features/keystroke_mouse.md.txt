# Keystroke and Mouse Operation Recording and Playback

EmEditor can record and play keystrokes and mouse operation against other applications. This capability allows you to automate certain tasks on the Desktop, on the browser, or on your favorite applications. For developers, this ability can be also used as
testing your applications. The [**Window** Object](../window/index) includes all sorts of properties that can tell almost everything about the window, and the [**Windows** Collection](../windows/index) can be used
to enumerate top-level windows or child windows for a certain window. The [**Shell** Object](../shell/index) sends keystroke and mouse activities and enumerates or find top-level windows.
