# Logical Coordinates

Logical coordinates refer to the coordinates in a document regardless of whether the
wrap mode is in use. In logical coordinates, line numbers are sums of the actual number
of newline characters in a document, and a column is the number of characters from the
previous newline character or from the start of the document if it's the first
line of the document.
