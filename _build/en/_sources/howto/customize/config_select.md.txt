# To Select a Configuration

- If you associate a file extension or extensions with a configuration, the
configuration associated with the file name extension will be selected
automatically when a file is opened. If syntax keywords are defined for the
configuration, the syntax will be highlighted accordingly.
- If you are creating a new document, select the correct configuration under
the **Tools** menu and syntax will automatically be highlighted as you type
if syntax keywords are defined for that configuration.

### Tips

- Most options related to how syntax is highlighted can be changed on the **Highlight (1)** and **Highlight (2)** pages in **Properties for Current**
**Configuration** under the **Tools** menu
