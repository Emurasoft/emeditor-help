# Select Events dialog box

This dialog box appears when the Events button on the [**My Macros** \
page](../index) of the [**Customize Macros** dialog box](../../index) is selected.

This dialog box is available only when logged on with the Administrative privileges.

### Select Events list box

Displays the list of events that can be selected as triggers at which a macro starts running automatically. If the **File Dropped** event is used, dropped files will not be opened automatically with EmEditor, but they must be handled by the specified macro using the [**DroppedFiles** collection](../../../../macro/dropped_files/index).

### Delay Time slider

For certain events, this slider can be used to adjust the delay time for which a macro waits before it runs.
