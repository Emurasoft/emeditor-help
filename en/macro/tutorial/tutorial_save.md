# Save Macro (Tutorial)

To save a macro, select the [Save Macro command](../../cmd/macros/macro_save). TheSave As dialog box should appear. EmEditor defaults to the My Macrosfolder under the My Documents folder. To change the default folder,
select the[Customize Macros](../../cmd/macros/customize_macro) [command](../../cmd/macros/customize_macro), then go to the [Options\
page](../../dlg/macro_customize/options/index) in the
[Customize Macros dialog box](../../dlg/macro_customize/index).

You can select either JavaScript or VBScript from the
Save as type drop-down list box
in the lower part of the dialog box.

Now give the macro file a name. Let's save our tutorial file as:

"tutorial"

Note: you do not need to specify an extension when you save the file. An
appropriate file extension will be appended automatically depending on what
scripting language the file was saved as.

ClickSave to save the macro under the name we've specified.
