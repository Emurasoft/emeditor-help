# Features

EmEditor Professional allows you to create functionally-rich macros using JavaScript or VBScript.
Features of the macros include:













## Notes

Many new methods in modern JavaScript/ECMAScript are not available in EmEditor. EmEditor macros use JScript 5.8 (equivalent to Internet Explorer 8.0), thus newer methods introduced after JScript 5.8 are not supported in EmEditor macros. Please check if the methods you want to use meet the required versions.
