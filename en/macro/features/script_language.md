# Support for JavaScript or VBScript (Features)

EmEditor uses JavaScript or VBScript for its macro language, so those who are
familiar with HTML or Windows scripting will be able to write macros with little
difficulty. For those unfamiliar with scripting languages, EmEditor can record
keystrokes, which can then be saved in a macro file that can easily be loaded in
different situations. With the use of JavaScript or VBScript, you can also
troubleshoot your code easily. For example, in JavaScript, you can use the
following statement to troubleshoot errors:

try { ... } catch(e) { ... }

When an error occurs, such as a file opening failure, the try-catch statement
allows the script to continue executing, instead of forcing it to terminate.
