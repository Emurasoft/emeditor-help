# Null Character

A character with the code value 0. It is not usually used in text files, and
thus files containing null characters are programs or data files other than text
files. These binary files (programs and data files except text files) cannot be
edited by EmEditor. Another program, such as a binary editor, must be used to edit
binary files if you need to edit them.
