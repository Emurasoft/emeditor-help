# System Default Encoding

A system encoding for non-Unicode programs used on the Windows Operating

**Panel**, selecting **Regional and Language Options**, selecting the **Advanced** page, and
then selecting the **Language for non-Unicode programs** if you are using Windows
2000/XP/2003/Vista. The English Windows Operating System usually selects Western
European by default. This is also called ANSI.
