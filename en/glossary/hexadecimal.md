# Hexadecimal

A base-16 alphanumerical system used in various programming languages,
usually written using characters 0-9 and A-F. Useful because each
hexadecimal figure can represent every byte (8 bits) as two consecutive
hexadecimal digits. Hexadecimal numbers have either an "0x" or
"U+" prefix or an
"h" suffix.
