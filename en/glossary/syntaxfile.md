# Syntax File

A file that outlines which words or phrases a program recognizes as
functionally important, and how to interpret them. In EmEditor, a syntax file
(denoted by an .esy extension) is used to define which strings are highlighted
and how a file of a certain file type is displayed in EmEditor.
