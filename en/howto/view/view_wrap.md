# To Change Wrapping Mode

Click
![No Wrap](../../images/wrapnone.gif)
on the Toolbar to not wrap lines at all,
![Wrap by Characters](../../images/wrapbychar.gif) to wrap by
the specified number of characters,
![Wrap by Window](../../images/wrapbywindow.gif) to
wrap by the size of the window, or
![Wrap by Page](../../images/wrapbypage.gif)
to wrap by the size of the page.

## Tips

- To change the character counts when wrapping by characters,
click
![Properties for Current Configuration](../../images/properties.gif)
(if you want to change only the current configuration) or
![Properties for All Configuration](../../images/allproperties.gif)
(if you want to change all configurations) to
show the **General** tab and change the **Normal Line Margin** and **Quoted Line Margin.**
