# To Select a Configuration

- If you associate a file extension or extensions with a configuration, the
configuration associated with the file name extension will be selected
automatically when a file is opened. If syntax keywords are defined for the
configuration, the syntax will be highlighted accordingly.
- If you are creating a new document, select the correct configuration under
theTools menu and syntax will automatically be highlighted as you type
if syntax keywords are defined for that configuration.

## Tips

- Most options related to how syntax is highlighted can be changed on theHighlight (1) andHighlight (2) pages inProperties for Current
Configuration under theTools menu
