# To Use Word Count Plug-in

TheWord Count plug-in is installed by default with EmEditor Professional. This plug-in counts words contained in the entire document and in a selection of text. The word count plug-in always counts the words in the entire document. It
counts the words in a selection if you make a selection of text. To use theWord Count plug-in:

1. Select text where you want to count words or select no text to count the entire document.
2. Click![Word Count](../../images/plugin_wordcount.gif) on thePlug-ins bar. Or on theTools menu, point toPlug-ins, and then clickWord Count.

TheWord Count custom bar appears. In the first column, the plug-in displays the types of query: characters, width, words, and lines. In the second column, the plug-in displays the count of words in the entire document. In the third column, the
plug-in displays the count of words in the selected text only.

You can click theRefresh Now button to recount the document and/or selection and update the word count, or press the "Refresh Automatically" button to reflect changes immediately. (This does not apply to a selection of text.)

TheWord Count Plug-in queries are customizable. Click on theCustomize button of theWord Count bar. TheCustomize Queries dialog box appears where you can create new, delete, copy and order queries. You can also clickReset to return all queries to
the default settings.

## To create a new query (such as Uppercase characters):

2. Name the new query in theTitle text box.
3. Specify the type by Number ofCharacters,Widths,Number of Words, orLogical Lines.
