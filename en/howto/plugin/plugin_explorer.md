# To Use Explorer Plug-in

TheExplorer plug-in is installed by default with EmEditor Professional. This plug-in displays the folder tree and allows you to open a file from the folder tree. To use theExplorer plug-in:

1. Click![Explorer](../../images/plugin_explorer.gif) on thePlug-ins bar. Or on theTools menu, point toPlug-ins, and then clickExplorer. TheExplorer custom bar will appear.
2. Find and click a file to open from the folder tree, and the file will be opened with EmEditor.

## Tips

- Press theF6 key orESC key to set the keyboard focus back to the editor.
- To enter the path directly, use thePath drop-down list.
- Â To display only certain file types, set the filter in the Filter drop-down list. Wild cards (\*,?) can be used. To separate multiple file specifications, use a semicolon (;).
- Right-click on the list to view hidden files, refresh, or clear thePath andFilter history.
- Single-click opens an item by default. You can change this behavior from the plug-in properties.
