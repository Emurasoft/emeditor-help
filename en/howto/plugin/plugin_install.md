# To Install Plug-ins

1. Download the plug-ins you want to install from the Internet. Many plug-ins
are available from the Emurasoft Home Page.
2. Follow the directions included with the downloaded plug-ins to properly
install them. Usually, copying the file with a **.DLL** extension to the
**PlugIns** folder in the EmEditor directory (usually, C:\\Program Files\\EmEditor3\\PlugIns)
will complete the installation.
3. When you run EmEditor, the plug-ins menu item that you installed will be
added under the **Tools** menu and a button will be added to the toolbar.

### Tips

- Use the newest version of EmEditor and the plug-ins to ensure that they
work together properly.
- You can customize toolbar buttons, menus and keyboard shortcuts.
