# To Uninstall Plug-ins

1. With Plug-ins that have uninstalling functions, select **Customize**
**Plug-ins...** under the **Tools** menu.
2. Select the plug-in that you want to uninstall, and click **Uninstall**.

## Tips

- With plug-ins that do not have uninstalling functions, manually delete the .DLL files
from the C:\\Program Files\\EmEditor\\PlugIns folder in order to uninstall.
- Instead of uninstalling, you can just disable a plug-in. To disable a plug-in, clear the check box of the item you want to disable in the **Customize Plug-ins** dialog box.
