# To Uninstall Plug-ins

1. With Plug-ins that have uninstalling functions, selectCustomize
Plug-ins... under theTools menu.
2. Select the plug-in that you want to uninstall, and clickUninstall.

## Tips

- With plug-ins that do not have uninstalling functions, manually delete the .DLL files
from the C:\\Program Files\\EmEditor\\PlugIns folder in order to uninstall.
- Instead of uninstalling, you can just disable a plug-in. To disable a plug-in, clear the check box of the item you want to disable in theCustomize Plug-ins dialog box.
