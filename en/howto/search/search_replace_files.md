# To Replace in Files

1. Select the [**Replace in**\
**Files** command](../../cmd/search/replace_in_files) under the Search menu to display the
[**Replace in Files** \
dialog box](../../dlg/replace_in_files/index).
2. Enter the text string to search for, the text string to replace with, the file type(s) (separated with a semicolon if more than one) and the folder(s) to search, then press the
**Replace All**
button.
3. If you check the **Keep Modified Files Open** check box,
all files that have had changes made will be left open, so that you can verify
the changes.
4. If the changes are correct, you can select the
[**Save and Close All** command](../../cmd/file/save_exit_all).
If you want to cancel the changes, you can select the
[**All Commands** command](../../cmd/tools/all_commands),
and select **File** \> **Close** \> [**Close All without Save** command](../../cmd/file/quit_all).

## Tips

- Check **Match Case** to differentiate between uppercase and lowercase.
- Check **Look in Subfolders**, to also search subfolders.
- If you do not check the
**Keep Modified Files Open** check box,
changes to files will be made immediately. If this is checked, the number of files replaced will be limited to the
**Maximum Number of Files to Replace if**
**Kept Open** text box on the
[**Search** \
page](../../dlg/customize/search/index) of the
[**Customize** dialog box](../../dlg/customize/index).
