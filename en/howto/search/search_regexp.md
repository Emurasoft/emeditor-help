# To Use Regular Expressions

Regular expressions can be used to find text patterns within an open document
or in multiple files. A regular expression is a pattern of text that consists of
ordinary characters, or literals, (for example, letters a-z) and special
characters, known as metacharacters. The pattern describes one or more strings
to match when searching text.

To use regular expressions:

1. Select theFind(to find text patterns in the current file),Replace (to find text patterns and replace them), orFind in Files
option (to find text patterns in multiple files) under theSearch menu.
2. Check theUse Regular Expressions box and any other search
parameters likeMatch Case.
3. Enter the regular expression to search for and clickFind. If usingFind in Files, also enter the file type(s) (separated with a semicolon if
more than one) and the folder(s) to search. If usingReplace, also
enter the text to replace the found text pattern with (back references can
also be used - see below).
