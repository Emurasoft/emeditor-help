# Version 15.5

October 27, 2015

## New General Features

- When starting EmEditor without opening files, the newStart window now appears (it can be disabled by settings). TheStart window allows you to selectpreviously used workspace (default workspace),recently used files, or arecently used folder by clicking the corresponding item with the mouse button or pressing the UP, DOWN, and Enter keys. TheStart window is designed to be lightweight and unobtrusive. When theStart window is opened, the keyboard focus is still in the editor, and entering text or selecting a command will hide theStart window. Also, pressing the DOWN key while a new document is opened brings up theStart window.
- The newExecutePlugin method allows you to call plug-in features from within macros. This allows, for example, a snippet feature temporarily even when theSnippets plug-in is not running. See "Examples to call plug-ins from macros" below.
- In previous versions, CSV separators and horizontal/vertical lines became invisible when selecting text. The new version makes them visible. Currently, there are no related options, but please let us know if you need this behavior optional.
- CSV modes, headings, and separator positions are now included in workspaces. We might include more options in workspaces. In that case, workspaces saved in the beta version might become useless. Important workspaces are encouraged to save backups before running this beta version.
- The limit for the filter string length was relaxed to 10,000 characters long.
- The limit for theheader andfooter strings in the [Split Current Document into Several Files wizard](../dlg/split_to_files/index) was relaxed to 10,000 characters long.
- TheExtract Columns,Join CSV, andSort by Multiple Columns dialog boxes now allows you to select multiple items move up and down in the list.
- By default, 3 macros ("Sum", "Validate XML", and "Wrap in HTML/XML tags") are installed to the Macros sub folder of the install folder. These macros are added to the My Macros list, but can be removed from the My Macros list. One removed from the list, they will not be added to the My Macros list.
- The Wrap by Window command was added to the context menu displayed when right-clicked in the Output bar.
- AfterCTRL \+F12 to start splitting an EmEditor window, pressingHOME,END,PAGE UP, orPAGE DOWN moves the splitter position to an edge of the window.
