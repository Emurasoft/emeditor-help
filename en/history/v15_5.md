# Version 15.5

October 27, 2015

## New General Features

- When starting EmEditor without opening files, the new **Start** window now appears (it can be disabled by settings). The **Start** window allows you to select **previously used workspace** (default workspace), **recently used files**, or a **recently used folder** by clicking the corresponding item with the mouse button or pressing the UP, DOWN, and Enter keys. The **Start** window is designed to be lightweight and unobtrusive. When the **Start** window is opened, the keyboard focus is still in the editor, and entering text or selecting a command will hide the **Start** window. Also, pressing the DOWN key while a new document is opened brings up the **Start** window.
- The new **ExecutePlugin** method allows you to call plug-in features from within macros. This allows, for example, a snippet feature temporarily even when the **Snippets** plug-in is not running. See "Examples to call plug-ins from macros" below.
- In previous versions, CSV separators and horizontal/vertical lines became invisible when selecting text. The new version makes them visible. Currently, there are no related options, but please let us know if you need this behavior optional.
- CSV modes, headings, and separator positions are now included in workspaces. We might include more options in workspaces. In that case, workspaces saved in the beta version might become useless. Important workspaces are encouraged to save backups before running this beta version.
- The limit for the filter string length was relaxed to 10,000 characters long.
- The limit for the **header** and **footer** strings in the [**Split Current Document into Several Files** wizard](../dlg/split_to_files/index) was relaxed to 10,000 characters long.
- The **Extract Columns**, **Join CSV**, and **Sort by Multiple Columns** dialog boxes now allows you to select multiple items move up and down in the list.
- By default, 3 macros ("Sum", "Validate XML", and "Wrap in HTML/XML tags") are installed to the Macros sub folder of the install folder. These macros are added to the My Macros list, but can be removed from the My Macros list. One removed from the list, they will not be added to the My Macros list.
- The Wrap by Window command was added to the context menu displayed when right-clicked in the Output bar.
- After **CTRL** \+ **F12** to start splitting an EmEditor window, pressing **HOME**, **END**, **PAGE UP**, or **PAGE DOWN** moves the splitter position to an edge of the window.

## Examples to call plug-ins from macros

**Calls the Snippets plug-in, and wraps the selected text with HTML/XML tags.**

editor.ExecutePlugin("Snippets.dll", eePluginUserMessage, 0, "<${1:p}>${2:${SelText}}</$1>$0" );

**Calls the Projects plug-in, and opens the specified solution file.**

editor.ExecutePlugin("Projects.dll", eePluginUserMessage, 0, "E:\\\Test\\\Test.eesln" );

**Calls the Search plug-in, searches the document for the specified string and shows the result list.**

editor.ExecutePlugin("Search.dll", eePluginUserMessage, eeFindReplaceCase \| eeFindReplaceRegExp, "Test" );

**Simply runs the specified plug-in**

editor.ExecutePlugin("E:\\dir\\plugin.dll", eePluginExecuteCommand \| eePluginAbsolutePath );

**Retrieves the specified plug-in status.**

status = editor.ExecutePlugin("E:\\dir\\plugin.dll", eePluginQueryStatus \| eePluginAbsolutePath );

## New Options

- The **Shortcut Key** text boxes in the [**Customize Tray Icon** dialog box](../dlg/tray/index) allow you to enter CTRL + SHIFT and ALT + SHIFT key combinations.
- The following REG\_DWORD values can be set in the HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\SOFTWARE\\EmSoft\\EmEditor v3\\Common key to set the width of drop-down list boxes.

**CWFind**: the **Find** drop-down list box in the **Find** toolbar. Default: 0xc8 (200)
