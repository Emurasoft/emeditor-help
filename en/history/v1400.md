# Version 14

December 9, 2013

## New General Features

- Enhanced multiple selections. When multiple selections are made, cursors appear simultaneously at multiple locations.
- Four new commands: [**Percent-encoding to Unicode (Current Encoding)**](../cmd/edit/decode_percent),
[**Unicode to Percent-encoding (Current Encoding)**](../cmd/edit/encode_percent),
[**Percent-encoding to Unicode (UTF-8)**](../cmd/edit/decode_percent_utf8), and
[**Unicode to Percent-encoding (UTF-8)**](../cmd/edit/encode_percent_utf8) were added. If the mouse pointer hovers on the text
encoded with percent encoding, a tooltip will automatically appear with decoded text.
- The [**Move Line Up**](../cmd/edit/move_line_up) and
[**Move Line Down**](../cmd/edit/move_line_down) commands were added.
- When the **Find** dialog box is open, selecting the **Find** command or pressing **CTRL + F** now sets the keyboard focus to the **Find**
drop-down list box now. Similarly, the **Replace**, **Find in Files**, and **Replace in Files** dialog boxes now sets the keyboard focus to the **Find**
drop-down list box when activated by the shortcuts or selecting from menus.
- Optimized to reduce the screen refresh when the **Customize Macros** or **Customize Menus** dialog is closed.
- Addressed the issue where EmEditor might have crashed when _TeamViewer_ was run simultaneously and signed in.

## New options

- The
**Close when Finished** check box in the [**Find in Files** dialog box](../dlg/find_in_files/index) and the
[**Replace in Files** dialog box](../dlg/replace_in_files/index).
- The **Output Options** drop-down list box was added to the [**Find in Files** dialog \
box](../dlg/find_in_files/index), where you can select the display option from
**File Names and Lines**, **File Names Only**, **Matched Lines Only**, and **Matched Strings Only**.
- The **Enter Maintenance Key** dialog box was added.
- The **Add Maintenance Key** button in the [**About EmEditor** dialog box](../dlg/about/index).
