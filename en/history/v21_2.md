# Version 21.2

October 26, 2021

## New General Features

- Many features that were previously available only for the Professional version were enabled also for the **Free** version. The new Free features include **Bookmarks**, **Markers**, **Compare files** (with default options only), **Spelling**, **Numbering**, **Full screen view**, **Workspaces**, **Macros** (**Record** and **Run** only, no scriptable macros), **Outline**, **Start window**, and many options in configuration properties. See the [comparison table](https://www.emeditor.com/text-editor-features/history/emeditor-free/) for details.
- The new version shows a dialog box to select **EmEditor Professional** or **EmEditor Free** to use when you launch EmEditor for the first time.
- The new version detects repeated steps, and show a notification tip with the **Enter Repeat Count** hyperlink. Clicking the **Enter Repeat Count** hyperlink brings up the **Repeat** dialog box, where you can specify the number of times to repeat the specified steps. The **Repeat** dialog box shows the selected steps as a macro, which you can save, edit, or select as the default macro. The **Repeat** dialog box can also be accessed on the **Edit** menu, and it is available both on **EmEditor Free** as well as on **EmEditor Professional**.
- The new version allows you to right-click on most menu items and toolbar buttons to display a context menu to show the **Assign Keyboard Shortcut** command. This command opens the **Keyboard** page of **Properties for All Configurations**, and selects the command where you right-clicked. This ability allows you to easily assign a keyboard shortcut for most commands including macros and plug-ins.
- **All Configurations** becomes the default setting for the **Keyboard Map**.
- Right-click on buttons on the **Macros**, **Plug-ins**, or **Tools** toolbar shows its specific context menu.
- The new version allows you to **click** (not double-click) on the **status bar** to change settings or show menus.
- Added the EmEditor icon to the Context Menu in Explorer.
- When the **Detect HTML/XML Charset** option is set, the new version uses Windows encodings where often mislabeled encodings are used in HTML (iso-8859-1 to windows-1252, iso-8859-9 to windows-1254, and iso-8859-11 to windows-874 according to the [WHATWG community Living Standard](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels)).
- The new version displays C1 controls (from U+0080 through U+009F) as "�".
- The new version shows a notification balloon tip if the **Auto Copy** feature is enabled when EmEditor is launched, which prevents users from forgetting to disable the feature after using it.
- Added **PowerShell** to the default external tools.

## New Options

- Added the **Show the modification mark on the left side of file name** option to the [**Window** page](../dlg/customize/window/index) of the **Customize** dialog box.
- Added the **Open the combined file when finished successfully**, **Run a macro against the combined file**, **Set this as the default macro** check boxes to the [Destination page](../dlg/combine_files/combine_wiz_dest) of the **Combine Files** wizard.
- Added the **▼** button to the [Destination page](../dlg/combine_files/combine_wiz_dest) of the **Combine Files** wizard to specify arguments such as **$(CombineRunSerial)** and **$(NumOfFiles)** to specify the destination file.
- Added the **Open all split files when finished successfully**, **Run a macro against each opened split files**, **Set this as the default macro** check boxes to the [Destination page](../dlg/split_to_files/split_files) of the **Split a File** wizard.
- Divided the **CSV page** of the **Customize** dialog box to [**CSV Formats**](../dlg/customize/csv/index) and [**CSV Options**](../dlg/customize/csv_options/index) pages.
- Add the **Min lines to detect** option to the [**CSV Formats** page](../dlg/customize/csv/index) of the **Customize** dialog box. Setting 2 on this option allows EmEditor to detect 2-line CSV files automatically. Previous versions required at least 3 lines exist in a CSV file to be detected automatically.
- Added the [**Repeat** dialog box](../dlg/repeat_count/index).
