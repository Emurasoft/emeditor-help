August 17, 2017

## New General Features

- Added thecolumn header for CSV modes. Clicking on the column header or the ruler will select the specified whole column. Clicking the left edge of the ruler or the top part of the line numbers will select the whole document.
- Split/Combine wizards became resizable even though the grip is invisible.
- The new version allows you to display both the Minimap and the vertical scroll bar simultaneously.
- The new version allows you to use the shortcut keys forDelete Right Word (Ctrl+Delete),Delete Word (Ctrl+Shift+Delete), andDelete Left Word (Ctrl+Backspace) in text boxes and drop-down list in many dialog boxes such asFind andReplace dialog boxes.
- Improved the behavior when a pasted text contains newlines or delimiters during the CSV cell selection mode or vertical selection mode.
- Even if theMatch Whole Word check box is set in theSearch page of theCustomize dialog box, EmEditor temporarily searches for non-word strings when theAdd Next Occurrence (Ctrl+R) orSelect All Occurrences (Ctrl+Shift+A) command is executed while the selection is not whole word(s).
- Greatly improved the speed ofReplace All when inserting newline codes while theMatch Case option is cleared.
