# Version 23.0

<!-- TODO Add date -->

## New General Features

- Redesigned help pages. {{profree}}
- Added the ability to show the embedded **Web Browser** within EmEditor using the **WebView2** control. The **Web Browser** is designed to be used in conjunction with macros. Writing a macro enables you to send specific text to a website. You can use `web` to access the **Document Object Model** (**DOM**) in the web page, For instance, `web.document.documentElement.outerHTML` retrieves the HTML of the current web document. The new **onLoad** event in JavaScript (V8) enables you to retrieve specific text from the web page when it is loaded. The initial home URL can be customized in the new **Web Browser** page of the **Customize** dialog box. {{pro}}
