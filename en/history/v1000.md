## New General Features

-Compare andSynchronize Scrolling features were added.
-Spelling features were added.
- Vertical selection of zero width at the right of end of lines will cause the selection move to end of each line in the selection. Then typing will insert text at end of each line (even if line lengths are not the same).
- The new [Numbering command](../cmd/edit/numbering) allows you to insert sequential numbers or characters at the cursor position or vertical selection.
- TheCSV mode now allows you to include newline characters in a cell. Embedded returns are displayed asM (CR) and/orJ (LF) in the reversed background color when theShow Control Characters check box is checked in the
Marks tab of configuration properties.

- Vertical selection is now limited to logical selections (multiple selections because of line wraps
are no longer allowed).
- In the previous version, a new untitled document was opened after
canceling the dialog box that appears when reloading a file with invalid
characters. This has been fixed, except when opening a huge file
asynchronously.
