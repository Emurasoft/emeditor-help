# Version 18.8

April 23, 2019

## New General Features

- Greatly improved the speed of opening very large files, Find/Replace/Filter, the
**Uppercase**, **Lowercase**, **Capitalize**, **Full-width**, and **Half-width** commands using multi-threaded code and the AVX-2 instruction set found in recent CPUs.
- Greatly improved the speed especially when the opened document contains very long lines.
- The new version allows you to press CTRL + SHIFT + V several times consecutively in all text boxes in
dialog boxes to paste previously copied text in the Clipboard history of the editor.
- Updated the IPTip.jsee macro to support new GeoLite2 CSV format. This
macro is used to show the country name as a tooltip when the mouse hovers on
IP v4 addresses if IP v4 active strings are enabled.
- Changed the default keyboard shortcuts. SHIFT + TAB is assigned as the [**Decrease Line Indent** command](../cmd/convert/unindent), and CTRL + SHIFT + T is assigned as the [**Most Recently Closed File** command](../cmd/file/most_recent_closed_file).
