# Version 18.2

October 10, 2018

## New General Features

- Greatly improved the speed of Find, Replace, Filter, CSV sort and other operations when opening very large files. Removed multi-threaded search/replace, as single-threaded search/replace is now faster.
- In the new version, the status bar is highlighted for important messages.
