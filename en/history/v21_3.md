# Version 21.3

November 24, 2021

## New General Features

- **Very large file** support on the **Free** version (previously, only the **Professional** version supported very large files).
- The new version allows date/time range and format in **[Number Range Expressions](../howto/search/number_range_syntax)** for **Find**/ **Replace**/ **Filter**. For instance, **\[ 10/28/2021 , 12/31/2021 "M/d/yyyy" \]** means all dates between 10/28/2021 and 12/31/2021. If a date format is omitted, the default date format is derived from the locale specified in the **Sort** page of the **Customize** dialog box.
- Redesigned the **Enter Number Range** dialog box, and the new version allows you to use any decimal point for a number range. For instance, **( 1,0 , 9,0 "," )** means all decimal numbers between 1 and 9 using a comma as the decimal point.
- The new version allows you to split a window to **3 panes**. Select the **Split Horizontally** or **Split Vertically** commands twice to split a window into 3 panes.
- The new version allows the **ENTER** key to be assigned in the **Keyboard** page of configuration properties. This allows you to assign the **ENTER** key as the [**Next Cell** (Cell Selection Mode Only)](../cmd/edit/csv_next_cell) command.
- Added a notification when it takes a long time to retrieve the **Windows Clipboard History**.
- Set the dialog box font to **Microsoft YaHei**, 9 point for Simplified Chinese, and **Microsoft JhengHei**, 9 point for Traditional Chinese.
- The new version synchronizes the cursor position as well as the scroll position when the **Synchronize Horizontal/Vertical Scrolling when Split** option is on.
- The new version shows a dialog box to remove nonexistent file names from the **My Macros** list if any when you show the **My Macros** page of the **Customize Macros** dialog box.
- Improved the speed of commands in the **Encode/Decode Selection** submenu on the **Edit** menu, **Remove Leading Spaces**, **Remove Trailing Spaces**, and **Filter in Column** commands.
