# Version 17.4

January 17, 2018

## New General Features

- Added more options to In the Selection Only regular expression searches. For instance, enabling the **'^' and '$' can Match Beginning and End of the Selection** option allows you to use regular expressions that can match only at the beginning/ending of the selection. Enabling the **Look Around during the Selection Only Search** option allows you to use lookahead/lookbehind expressions to look outside of the selection while matching only in the selection.
- Added more options to the CSV cell selection mode, which allow you to keep the number of columns the same while editing, or double-click outside to create a new cell.
- The Boost.Regex version was updated to v1.66.0.
- Reverted the font size in dialog boxes from 9 point to 8 point except for Chinese.
- Optimized icons for high-DPI monitors.
- Optimized for Windows 7 or later. Digital signatures for executable files use SHA256 certificates only, and previous dual signatures with SHA1 certificates were deprecated. This version does NOT support Windows Vista/Server 2008.
- In an effort to prevent anti-virus software false alarms, the file extension of the install was changed from .exe to .msi.
- Greatly improved the speed of Replace All (when the find string contains newline characters and the replace string does not) and its Undo operations. See the test results table below.

### Test results:

|  | v16.5 | v16.6 | v16.9 | v17.4 | Comparison to v16.5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Replace All "9\\n" with "a" | 32.7 seconds | 22.4 seconds | 0.17 seconds | 0.141 seconds | 232 times faster |
| Undo the above | 73.5 seconds | 29.2 seconds | 27.8 seconds | 6.89 seconds | 10.7 times faster |

\\* All test conditions are the same as [Version 16.6](v16_6).

## New Options

- Added the **'^' and '$' can Match Beginning and End of the Selection** and **Look Around during the Selection Only Search** check boxes to the [**Advanced (Find)** dialog box](../dlg/advanced/index).
- Added the **Prompt when Very Long Lines Exist** check box to the [**Edit** page](../dlg/customize/edit/index) of the **Customize** dialog box.
- Added the **Keep Number of Columns Same while Editing in Cell Selection Mode**, **Press TAB key to Create a New Cell in Cell Selection Mode**, **Double-Click Header/Line Numbers to Create a New Column/Line in Cell Selection Mode**, and **Double-Click Outside to Create a New Cell in Cell Selection Mode** check boxes to the [**CSV** page](../dlg/customize/csv/index) of the **Customize** dialog box.
- Added more regular expression samples to the menu displayed when the **>** button is clicked in the **Find**/**Replace** dialog boxes.

## Plug-in New Features

- The **Word Count** plug-in now uses the characters specified in the **Treat the following characters as alphanumeric** text box in the [**Edit** page](../dlg/customize/edit/index) of the **Customize** dialog box as components of a word. For instance, specifying an apostrophe (') in the text box causes the plug-in to count _I'm_ as one word, which is consistent with the number of words displayed in the status bar.

## Plug-in API New Features

- Added the **FLAG\_FIND\_BOL**, **FLAG\_FIND\_EOL**, and **FLAG\_FIND\_LOOKAROUND** constants to the _nFlags_ member of the [**FIND\_REPLACE\_INFO** structure](../plugin/structure/find_replace_info).

## Macro New Features

- Added the **eeExFindBOL**, **eeExFindEOL**, and **eeExFindLookaround** constants to the _nExFlags_ parameter of the [**Find** method](../macro/selection/selection_find) and [**Replace** method](../macro/selection/selection_replace) of the **Selection** object.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed the bug where removing all newline codes from a very large file could crash.
- Fixed various issues related to very large file editing. For instance, the cursor position after a series of certain operations on very large files containing a double-byte character might not have been correct.
- Fixed certain regular-expression searches and replaces. For instance, in the Selection Only search, the regular expression "^a+" could match incorrect positions when the Find Previous button was clicked in the Find dialog box.
