# Version 21.6

March 23, 2022

## New General Features

- The new version allows you to specify character ranges by using the **[Unicode Script](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24/tr24-32.html)** and **[Unicode General Category](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#General_Category_Values)** when setting the **Character Check** page of **Configuration properties**. (EmEditor Professional and EmEditor Free)
- The new version displays **Unicode Script** and **Unicode General Category** on the **Character Code Value** command. (EmEditor Professional and EmEditor Free)
- Supported all possible **Emoji** sequences. (EmEditor Professional and EmEditor Free)
- Updated the **Unicode name** database to Unicode v14.0.0. (EmEditor Professional and EmEditor Free)
- Added the **\\D** and **\\T** expressions to the **[Replacement Expression Syntax](../howto/search/replacement_expression_syntax)**. These expressions can be useful to convert several dates/times expressed by different formats into one date/time format. For instance, if the matched date is "2022-03-31", and the replacement expression is "\\Dm/d/yyyy", the result will become "3/31/2022". (EmEditor Professional and EmEditor Free)
- Added the **\\Nc**, **\\Nd**, **\\NC**, and **\\ND** expressions to the **[Replacement Expression Syntax](../howto/search/replacement_expression_syntax)** to [normalize strings](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/). (EmEditor Professional and EmEditor Free)
- The new version allows you to **drag and drop** a file from **Explorer** to the **Filter** box in the **Filter** toolbar and a list box in the **Advanced Filter**, **Batch Find**, **Batch Replace**, **Batch Find/Replace in Files** dialog boxes to create a linked file. The linked file can contain multiple search strings divided by newlines. (EmEditor Professional only)
- The **Extract All** button on the **Filter** toolbar is now a drop-down box, and clicking the button will display a menu where you can select between the **Extract All Lines** and **Extract Matched Strings** commands. The **Extract Matched Strings** command will extract only one string per line if multiple strings are matched. (EmEditor Professional only)
- Significantly improved the speed of the **Advanced Filter** command when many search strings (not regular expressions or number ranges) are combined with the **Logical Disjunction (OR) to the Previous Condition** option. (EmEditor Professional only)
- Greatly improved the speed of the **Join CSV** command when the **... contains ...**, **... starts with ...**, or **... ends with ...** conditions are selected. (EmEditor Professional only)
- Greatly improved the speed of **Multi-Find** in the **Find** dialog box when many search strings are defined. (EmEditor Professional only)

## New Options

- Added the **Link File** check box and ▼ on the right side of the **Add** button to the [**Advanced Filter** dialog box](../dlg/advanced_filter/index).

Clicking the ▼ part will allow you to add a linked file. The linked file can contain multiple search strings divided by tabs and newlines (Tabs can be used to separate find and replace strings). The **Count Matches** option in the **Batch Find/Batch Replace** dialog box will be ignored if **linked files** are included in the List box and **Multi-Find Next** or **Multi-Find Previous** button is selected. (EmEditor Professional only)
