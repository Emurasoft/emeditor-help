These expressions can be useful to convert several dates/times expressed by different formats into one date/time format.

The linked file can contain multiple search strings divided by newlines. (EmEditor Professional only)

TheExtract Matched Strings command will extract only one string per line if multiple strings are matched. (EmEditor Professional only)
