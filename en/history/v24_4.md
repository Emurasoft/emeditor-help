# Version 24.4

October 12th, 2024

## New General Features

- Introduced a **Markdown design view** that offers a near-WYSIWYG experience for editing **Markdown** files. The new **Markdown** toolbar provides easy access to new commands like **Bold**, **Italic**, and **Hyperlink**, enabling you to format your text and add links effortlessly. However, please note that the **Markdown design view** has some limitations; for example, all images are shown as small icons, and newline codes may not be interpreted the same way as they are in the **Web Preview**. {{pro}}
- In the new version, the Copy All to Other command now closes the source document.
