# Version 16.1

June 29, 2016

## New General Features

- The new Cell toolbar was added. By default, the Cell toolbar appears when a CSV document is active and the cell selection mode is selected. The Cell toolbar allows you to edit the selected cell(s). Unlike the editor behavior, the Cell toolbar does not show the surrounding double quotes, and embedded delimiters are escaped. Newline codes are displayed as newlines.
- Supports most of HTML5 named character references.
- Many dialog boxes including a list with check boxes (such as Extract Columns), the new version allows you to drag and drop items to arrange the order in the list, and the **Enable/Disable Selected Items** check box now becomes **Enable/Disable All** when only 1 or 0 item is selected in the list.
- Per-Monitor DPI-Aware. (v16.1.4)
- Added the **Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app** version. It supports only PC versions of Windows 10 Build 14393 (Anniversary Update) or later. EmEditor does NOT support Windows 10 Mobile, Xbox, or HoloLens. (v16.1.5)

- The **Enable/Disable All** or **Enable/Disable Selected Items** check box was added to the [**Status** page](../dlg/customize/status/index) of the **Customize** dialog box.
- The **Add EOF (Ctrl+Z, U+001A or 1AH)** check box became enabled even when the **Selection** or **Document** is selected from the **Input** drop-down list box in the [**External Tool Properties** dialog box](../dlg/tools/properties/index).
