- Added the new [**Sort Reverse** command](../cmd/sort/sort_reverse), which allows you to sort document(s) in reversed order.
- Greatly improved the speed of switching to a **CSV mode**, and the **Syntax Check** (CSV) and **Adjust Separator Position (Whole Document)** commands using multi-threaded code and the AVX-2 instruction set found in recent CPUs .
- Greatly improved the speed of the Delete Duplicate Lines command on a very large file using multi-threaded code and the AVX-2 and SSE4.2 instruction sets found in recent CPUs.
