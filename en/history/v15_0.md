# Version 15.0

April 6, 2015

## New General Features

- You can now manage multiple workspaces. The **Open Workspace**, **Save Workspace**, **Save Workspace As**, and **Recent Workspace** (multiple
items) commands were added. By default, the **Workspace** popup menu was added to the **File** menu, and various workspace commands were added inside the popup menu.
- The new advanced filter allows you to specify a search range for the filter. It also allows you to specify a logical disjunction (logical OR) for multiple levels of the filter. If this is not specified, a logical conjunction (Logical AND) is used for multiple levels of the filter.
- In the **Filter** toolbar, previously used advanced filters
can be now selected from the history.
- The **Bookmark All** and **Extract All** buttons were added to the **Filter** toolbar.
- The **Filter** command was added to the context menu displayed when you
click on a marker on the **Markers** toolbar. Also, clicking a marker while
pressing CTRL now works as a filter.
- The default context menu now includes the **Filter** command, which allows
you to use the selected text or the word at cursor as a filter.
- The UAC prompt will not appear anymore in the **Import and Export** wizard.
- The **Split Current Document into Several Files** command now allows you to specify an existing file as the source file. This enhancement allows you to split a very large file larger than 248 GB.
- The **Output As** drop-down list box was added to the
**Find in Files** dialog
box, which allows you to directly open the searched file and filter the file
with the specified searched string.
- In the **[Find in Files](../dlg/find_in_files/index)** and **[Replace in Files](../dlg/replace_in_files/index)**
dialog boxes, the **In Folder** drop-down list can now contain up to 10,000
characters separating multiple folders by ‘\|’. Folder names surrounded by
double-quotes can be specified now. A warning message now appears when a
folder doesn't exist.
- When the **Bookmark All** button was clicked in the **Find** dialog box, the
status bar now shows how many bookmarks were increased.
- Improved many dialog boxes. For example, when closing a document, the
**YES** and **NO** button labels in the "Save
Changes?" message box were changed to **Save** and **Don't Save**, words that include the actual tasks.
- The **Free** version of EmEditor now adds the **Find in Files** and
**Replace in**
**Files** command.
