**Outline Bar** and the **Outline Guide**.
- The **Copy** and **Copy All** commands were
added to the right-click menu of the **Outline** **Bar**.
- The new version can adjust the window size automatically when a custom bar is opened.
- With the new version, the **wrapping mode** can be set independently per document, not only per configuration.
- The [**Comment**](../cmd/edit/edit_comment) and [**Uncomment**](../cmd/edit/edit_uncomment) commands now work at the current line if there is no selection.
- If the main menu has been already customized, the new **Outline Bar** and **Outline Guide** commands will be added to the **View** sub menu automatically.
- If the main toolbar has been already customized, the new **Outline** button will be added to the toolbar automatically.
- When collapsed text is copied and pasted into another location, the new version maintains the collapse/expand state in the copied text.
