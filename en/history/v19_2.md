# Version 19.2

September 18, 2019

## New General Features

- SupportedAVX-512 andSHA instruction sets found in recent CPUs (64-bit only).
- Improved the speed by dividing the core program into 3 executable files -- _ee512.exe_ for AVX-512, _ee256.exe_ for AVX-2, and _ee128.exe_ for SSE2 instruction sets (64-bit only). EmEditor automatically selects the most optimized executable file by default, or a user can select any executable file as long as the current CPU supports the corresponding instruction set.
- The new version displays more error information duringFind in Files andReplace in Files if any files are skipped from search due to errors.
- The new version displays the number of matches or strings replaced in the status bar afterFind in Files andReplace in Files.
- Greatly improved the speed of opening very large files,Delete Duplicate Lines,Find in Files,Replace in Files, and variousSort commands.
