# Version 22.2

January 25th, 2023

## New General Features

- The new version initiates a CSV detection in the beginning of opening a very large file, which allows you to view the file in a CSV mode without waiting for the entire file loaded.
- The new version may check CSV syntax in the background, which allows you to view the file without waiting for the syntax check finished. Previous versions check CSV syntax always in the foreground.
- The new version allows CSV detections work even if embedded newlines exist.
- Improved the reliability and robustness especially when dealing with very large files in low memory situations.
- The new version shows a a message box indicating a low memory situation as well as a clickable URL to explain how to increase the virtual memory if the situation happens.
- Added the **\\V** expression to the [Replacement Expression Syntax](../howto/search/replacement_expression_syntax) and allowed you to use the **V8 JavaScript engine** for replacement expressions.
- The [**CommitList** plug-in](../howto/plugin/plugin_commit_list) can now call the pull, push, and fetch commands.
- Added the ability to filter history in **CommitList**.
- Improved crash reporting.
- Updated **CSS HTML Validator Lite** to v21.0.
- Improved the speeds of adjusting CSV separator positions, CSV syntax check, switching to the normal mode from a CSV mode, and various conversion and sort commands while working on a very large file.
