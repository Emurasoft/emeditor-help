# Version 22.4

May 17th, 2023

## New General Features

- Improved the behavior and progress message when opening a very large file from a slow or network drive. <profree />
- Improved the response time when canceling **Find in Files**. <profree />
- Added the **syntax check** feature using **Language Server Protocol** (LSP). <pro />
- Improved the **CommitList** plugin by adding the ability to checkout commits and create new branches. <pro />
- Added the ability to update highlighting while you type in the **Find** dialog or the **Find** toolbar. When this feature is enabled, highlighting occurs only when the **Find**/ **Replace**/ **Find in Files**/ **Replace in Files** dialog box or **Find** toolbar is visible. This feature is disabled by default, but can be enabled by selecting the **Auto Highlight** in the menu displayed when you click the **>** button next to the **Find** drop-down list box in the **Find** dialog box. <profree />
- Improved the scrolling behavior while extending the selection using the mouse. When you drag the mouse (move the mouse pointer while pressing the left mouse button) past the edge of the editor window, the mouse pointer shape changes. The farther you move the mouse pointer past the edge of the window, the faster the scrolling speed becomes. If you move the mouse pointer too far away from the window, the scrolling behaves as if you were dragging the scroll box (thumb). This mode allows you to move the endpoint of the selection easily to any position in the document. By default, the Minimap will be displayed when you enter this mode. Pressing the **ESC** key while still pressing the left mouse button will switch back to the normal selection mode. <profree />
- The new version scrolls 8 characters right or left when you click the horizontal scrollbar arrows. <profree />
- Changed the shortcuts on the main menu ( **Convert** and **Tools**). <profree />
- Changed the behavior on paste - the new version pastes as box if the clipboard text contains newlines and the current selection mode is multi-selection. <profree />
- Improved the reliability and robustness especially when dealing with very large files in low memory situations. <profree />
- The new version calls "beta versions" as "preview versions". <profree />
- Improved the speed of **Find in Files**, **Delete Columns**, **Clear Contents**, **Sort Randomly**, and base 64 encoding/decoding commands. The speed of the **Sort Randomly** command was further improved by using a fast pseudorandom number generator ( [Xoshiro-cpp](https://github.com/Reputeless/Xoshiro-cpp)).
