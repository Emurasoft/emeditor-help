# Version 16.4

January 24, 2017

## New General Features

- The newAuto Copy feature allows you to copy the selection automatically to the Clipboard without selecting the Copy command (CTRL + C). While theAuto Copy mode is on, the selection will be copied to the Clipboard immediately before the selection is deselected or deleted, immediately before the active document is switched, or the editor loses the keyboard focus. However, it does not work during the CSV cell mode.
- TheDelete/Bookmark Duplicate Lines (Advanced) command andSort by Multiple Columns commands can be recorded as a macro now.
- When deleting duplicates of an already sorted document, setting theCompare Adjacent Lines Only (Assume Presorted) check box dramatically increases the speed of the operation.
