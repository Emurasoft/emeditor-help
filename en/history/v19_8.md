# Version 19.8

April 24, 2020

## New General Features

- Added an option to use[uchardet](https://github.com/BYVoid/uchardet) (C++ fork of Mozilla Charset Detectors), and improved file encoding detection when the Detect All option is used to open files.
- Added an ability to split a file with newlines at every specified number of bytes, and run a macro against each opened document while opening multiple files (the newAdvanced Open command). This feature may be useful when you want to split fixed-length record data files (that didn't contain newlines) with newlines at every record while opening them, and convert them into a CSV format using a macro.
- The new version allows you to record converting CSV formats as a macro ( [ConvertCsv method](../macro/document/convert_csv)).
- Improved tiled window behaviors when comparing two documents. For instance, minimizing one window while two windows are tiled to compare, the other window will also minimize simultaneously. In WIndows 10, the new version removed a visual gap between two tiled windows.
- Added the very dark mode (Windows 10 Build 17763 or later only). This feature is still beta since Windows API does not officially support the dark mode against desktop apps. It may not be supported on future versions of Windows.
- Added commands to apply Unicode Normalization defined in " [Unicode Standard Annex #15 Unicode Normalization Forms](http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/)".
- Added an option to display a correct series of Hangul Jamo as composed characters. For example, "ᄒ ᅡ ᆫ ᄀ ᅳ ᆯ" (without spaces) will be displayed as "한글" if this option is enabled. It is also effective to display old Hangul correctly where composed characters are unavailable.
- Improved the speed of multiline regular expression searches and replaces.
