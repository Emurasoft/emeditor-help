# Version 20.1

September 1, 2020

## New General Features

- Added an ability to change the quotation mark associated with each CSV format. Added the [**Concordance load file (DAT)** format](https://help.ediscoveryplatform.com/home/technical-notes-available/tiff-image-dat-load-file) to the default CSV format list.
- Sets the encoding for new files as **UTF-8 without a Unicode Signature**, and sets the **Prefer UTF-8** option on by default for **Text** configurations. By default, US-ASCII files will be opened as UTF-8 without Signature.
- Enhanced [command line **/l** and **/cl** options](../howto/file/file_commandline) to allow negative numbers to specify the number of lines from the last line, or number of characters from the end of line.
- The new version moves a selected string in the clipboard history to the newest position in the history by default, and replaces the current Clipboard with the selected string.
- Added the **Begin Filter** and **End Filter** options to the Advanced Filter feature to allow you to set only a range of lines as filtered lines.
- Added an ability to specify the **file position** in the Jump dialog box to specify the jump destination. Changing the **File Position** will update the **Line** and **Column** in the **Jump** dialog box before you confirm the jump, and vice versa.
- In 64-bit, ee128.exe, ee256.exe, and ee512.exe are now rebuilt as DLL (ee128.dll, ee256.dll, and ee512.dll). In 32-bit, ee128.dll was added to the install.
- Added EECommon.dll file to the install.
- Updated the **Sum** macro to be able to sum numbers in selected cells in CSV documents.
- Improved the speed of opening very large files by multi-threading.

\\* 2.70 GB, 200,000,000 lines, ASCII random data file. 16 threads, Windows 10 (64-bit), Core i9-9900K, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD. The _First time_ and _second time_ mean that the first time and second time opening of the file after restarting Windows. The second time is usually faster than the first time because of the [Windows cache mechanism](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/performance-tuning/subsystem/cache-memory-management/). EmEditor does NOT leave any temporary files to increase the speed of opening files.
