# Version 20.4

December 15, 2020

## New General Features

- Added the **Notifications** feature. When events like " _A New Version is available_", " _A CSV file was detected_", etc. occur, EmEditor displays a balloon tip in the bottom-right corner of the window which allows you to confirm the notification or to select an action. Even after the balloon tip disappears after several seconds, you can still click on the Notification icon (ðŸ’¬) on the status bar to display the Notification bar where you will find a list of the previous notifications. Clicking one of the items will bring up a dialog box to confirm or select an action for the notification.
- Improved the **Update Checker** behavior.
- Added an ability to set the global maximum memory size in MB, and optimized memory and thread usage when opening multiple large files simultaneously.
- Improved the speed of the **Delete Duplicate Lines** and **Compare** commands.
