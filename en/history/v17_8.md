# Version 17.8

June 13, 2018

## New General Features

- Added an ability to open only those lines that match a specifiedOpen Filter. This allows you to open only the lines that include a specific string (such as an ID or name) from a very large file, minimizing memory usage. The feature also allows you to edit or sort the specified lines quickly.
- The [Character Code Value dialog box](../dlg/character_code_value_dialog/index) has an updated layout, putting the Unicode codepoints just under the character, followed by the encoding information. Additionally, UTF-8 character encoding info has been added.
- The number of lines, number of characters, number of words, and newline character displayed in the status bar will show "(Click)" if the selection is large or a large file is loaded. Clicking this text will update the displayed values.
- EmEditor can now save workspaces periodically and restore workspaces in case, for example, the operating system crashes or hardware failure occurs due to power outage. EmEditor can also save workspaces on crash as previous versions did.
- A dialog box with a progress bar now appears while restoring a workspace. Warning messages can appear in the Output bar if unexpected events happen while restoring a workspace.
- Added theSave Workspace button to theSave changes? dialog box displayed when a modified document is about to close. Clicking this button will save all modified documents as a workspace with the Undo information, and next time when EmEditor is open, all the modified documents will be restored and become ready to be undone.
