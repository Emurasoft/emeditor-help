# Version 15.7

December 16, 2015

## New General Features

- You can now select **Onigmo** as the regular expression engine in addition to **Boost.Regex**. If **Onigmo** is selected as the regular expression engine, you can use character types such as **\\p{Han}**, **\\p{Hangul}**, **\\p{Hebrew}**, etc. To find more details about the **Onigmo** regular expression syntax, please view [https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo/blob/master/doc/RE](https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo/blob/master/doc/RE) and Unicode Properties [https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo/blob/master/doc/UnicodeProps.txt](https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo/blob/master/doc/UnicodeProps.txt).
- This version allows you to search and replace CR and LF separately.
- If you try to search for a string containing \\r (CR) while the **Treat CR and LF separately** option is disabled, the prompt message _“The search string contains CR. Do you want to enable the Treat CR and LF Separately option?”_ will appear now.
- If the last line of the document is empty, regular expressions will not match the last line anymore.
