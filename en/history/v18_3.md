## New General Features

- Added random ordering to Sort.
- The new version can open **Binary (Hexadecimal View)** files with 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 bytes per line. Selecting larger bytes per line results in faster loading of binary files.
- Re-enabled multi-threaded search/replace when a large file is opened without temporary files to improve its speed.
- Greatly improved the speed of **Remove Newline Characters** and Validate CSV documents with embedded newlines.
- Added the **Bookmarked Lines Only**, **Unbookmarked Lines Only**, and **Match Newline Characters** buttons to the **Filter** toolbar.
- Allows you to refresh/abort Filter by pressing the ENTER/ESC key while the keyboard focus is on the Column drop-down list box in the Filter toolbar.
- [The new version allows you to deselect a selection while in multiple selection mode, by CTRL-clicking a selection.](https://www.emeditor.com/forums/topic/multiple-selection-editing/)
- [You can now enable **Read Only** with unsaved documents.](https://www.emeditor.com/forums/topic/read-only/)
