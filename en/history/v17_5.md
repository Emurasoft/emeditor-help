# Version 17.5

February 27, 2018

## New General Features

- In the CSV selection mode, the **AutoFill Option** button now appears when the AutoFill handle is dragged. Clicking on this button will show the **AutoFill Option** menu where you will be able to choose the type of AutoFill, and to either duplicate the original value or increment the value with each cell.
- EmEditor now determines the width of characters according to the " [Unicode Standard Annex #11 - East Asian Width](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/)". There is a new option to treat ambiguous characters as fullwidth.
- Mitigations for DLL hijacking vulnerability. The new version has various new checks, which includes comparing digital signatures of EmEditor executables and DLL files.

## New Options

- Added the **Treat Ambiguous Width Characters as Fullwidth** check box to the **Edit Options** list box in the **Edit** tab of the **Customize** dialog box.

## Plug-in API New Features

- Added the [**EE\_AUTOFILL** message](../plugin/message/ee_autofill), the [**Editor\_AutoFill** inline function](../plugin/macro/editor_autofill), and the [**AUTOFILL\_INFO** structure](../plugin/structure/autofill_info).
- Added the **EI\_REFRESH\_COMMON\_SETTINGS** command to the [**EE\_INFO** message](../plugin/message/ee_info).

## Macro New Features

- Added the **[AutoFill](../macro/document/autofill)** method to the **Document** object.
- Added the [**RefreshCommonSettings** method](../macro/editor/refresh_common_settings) to the **Editor** object.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where double-clicking a word might not select the correct word when the CSV selection mode is disabled.
- Fixed a bug related to the Save All with Encoding dialog box.
- Fixed a bug where recording a macro did not capture the new flags (eeExFindBOL, eeExFindEOL, and eeExFindLookaround).
