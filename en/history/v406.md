# Version 4.06

August 26, 2004

- Fixed a bug that the Setup in v4.05 could not install template files (template.\*).
- If encoding is UTF-8 or Unicode, the status bus now shows with or without signature (BOM).
- When a file is changed outside, a prompt message will appear only when the EmEditor has a focus.
- After the installed folder is changed, fixed an issue that EmEditor does not appear in HTML editor list in Internet Explorer even if "Add EmEditor to Internet Explorer v5 or later HTML editor list" is checked during the installation.
- Worked around an issue that Cascade/Tile Windows command did not move the active window on Windows XP SP2.
- Optimized the Replace All command.
