# Version 20.3

November 17, 2020

## New General Features

- Improved the behavior when a new version of EmEditor is detected, and improved the overall update experience. When a new version is detected, a tooltip appears in the right bottom corner of the EmEditor window, shows you a new version number, and allows you to install now, or select whether to install the new version on exit. Also added options related to theUpdate Checker to theStart Window, which allows you to enable/disable the automatic update, install now, or allows you to select whether to install the new version on exit.
- Removed _emedshl.dll_ and _emedshl64.dll_ files from installers, and added Registry keys and values related to the Windows Explorer context menu. This will prevent the _Files in use_ message box from appearing during future uninstall/updates.
- The desktop shortcut will not be created anymore by the default installation. You can still create the desktop shortcut by selecting theCustom install.
- Added theConvert All andDisable All commands to a tooltip displayed when hovering over HTML/XML character references, universal character names, or percent-encoding active strings.
- Improved the speed of various operations includingFind with theCount Matches option,Filter,Replace All, andCompare in very large files.
