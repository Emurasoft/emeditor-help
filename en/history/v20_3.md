# Version 20.3

November 17, 2020

## New General Features

- Improved the behavior when a new version of EmEditor is detected, and improved the overall update experience. When a new version is detected, a tooltip appears in the right bottom corner of the EmEditor window, shows you a new version number, and allows you to install now, or select whether to install the new version on exit. Also added options related to the **Update Checker** to the **Start Window**, which allows you to enable/disable the automatic update, install now, or allows you to select whether to install the new version on exit.
- Removed _emedshl.dll_ and _emedshl64.dll_ files from installers, and added Registry keys and values related to the Windows Explorer context menu. This will prevent the _Files in use_ message box from appearing during future uninstall/updates.
- The desktop shortcut will not be created anymore by the default installation. You can still create the desktop shortcut by selecting the **Custom** install.
- Added the **Convert All** and **Disable All** commands to a tooltip displayed when hovering over HTML/XML character references, universal character names, or percent-encoding active strings.
- Improved the speed of various operations including **Find** with the **Count Matches** option, **Filter**, **Replace All**, and **Compare** in very large files.
