# Version 16.2

October 5, 2016

## New General Features

- The Filter toolbar allows you to specify additional lines to display before and after matched lines. The **Number of Additional Visual Lines Above Matched Lines** and **Number of Additional Visual Lines Below Matched Lines** drop-down list boxes were added to the Filter toolbar.
- The **Find Extract** feature allows you to specify the number of lines above and below the matched lines, and specify the separator.
- The **Extract All** button was added to the **Replace** dialog box, and allows you to extract all matched strings using regular expressions, and replace using replace expressions. For example, enter **<h3>(.\*?)</h3>** in the **Find** text box, **\\1** in the **Replace with** text box while the **Use Regular Expressions** check box is set, and clicking the **Extract All** will extract all the strings between **<h3>** and **</h3>** as a new document.
- Optimized the speed while filtered.
