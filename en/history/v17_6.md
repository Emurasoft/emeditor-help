April 18, 2018

## New General Features

- Greatly improved the speed of the **Delete Duplicate Lines** command when very large files are used.
- Improved the speed of sort commands.
- New support for **DirectWrite**, which uses sub-pixel anti-aliasing to improve the rendering of text. Also supported color fonts such as Emoji (Color fonts are supported only on Windows 8.1 or later). DirectWrite is turned off by default. After opening a file in EmEditor, changing options in the **Text Rendering** page of the **Customize** dialog box will preview the changes in the EmEditor window before confirming the changes.
- The Character Code Value dialog window now includes the Unicode name.
- New configuration for **Markdown**.
- Improved the **Flash Fill** command.
