# Version 15.1

May 11, 2015

## New General Features

- Greatly improved the execution speed of **Find**, **Replace All**, **Filter**, **Undo** **Replace All**, and **Select All Occurrences** commands. When dealing with large files (more than 10,000 lines), these commands run as **multi-threads**.
- EmEditor can be customized to show the execution time for many tasks.
- Added the **Extract Columns** command, which allows you to extract specified columns in the CSV document and create a new document.
- When search is made, the status bar shows clear separation between matched occurrences and matched lines after search (there might be more than one occurrences in a single line).
- **Find in Files** now allows you to ignore binary files.
- Allows you to perform a **per-user** install. A **per-user** install will not display **User Account Control** (**UAC**) prompts on Windows 7 or later. The **per-user** install is possible by selecting the **Only for me** radio button on the **Installation Type** dialog during the install. If a quiet install is made inside the Command Prompt, add the "MSIINSTALLPERUSER=1" option. The Installation Type cannot be changed during updates.
- **.eeWorkspace** files are now associated with EmEditor. Double-clicking **.eeWorkspace** files can now restore the workspace with EmEditor.
- All the shortcut settings can be changed now even in the per-user install.
- The **Associate with EmEditor** dialog box can be accessed without administrative privileges now.
- The text editor is now horizontally scrolled when necessary when a user selects a column in the Column drop-down list on the Filter toolbar so that the specified column will become visible.
- A context menu now appears when each item in the **status bar** is right-clicked, and selecting the **Copy** will copy the contents to the Clipboard.

## New Options

- The [**Extract Columns** dialog box](../dlg/extract_columns/index) was added.
- The **Show Execution Time** check box was added to the [**Status** page](../dlg/customize/status/index) of the **Customize** dialog box.
- The **Ignore Binary Files** and the **Show Ignored Files in Results** check boxes in the [**Advanced** dialog box](../dlg/advanced/index).
- The **Display a tray icon when EmEditor launches** check box was added to the [**Shortcut** page](../dlg/customize/shortcut/index) of the **Customize** dialog box.
- All the contents in the **Customize More Shortcuts** dialog box were moved to the [**Shortcut** page](../dlg/customize/shortcut/index) of the **Customize** dialog box.
- In the **Header and footer** page of the
[**Split Current Document into Several Files** wizard](../dlg/split_to_files/index), the **Header \[>\]** menu now contains **$(FirstLine)**, which allows you to insert the first line of the document as the header.
- The **Number of Threads** drop-down list box was added to the [**Advanced** page](../dlg/customize/advanced/index) of the **Customize** dialog box.
