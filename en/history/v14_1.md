# Version 14.1

December 23, 2013

## New General Features

- Enhanced multiple selections: you can now use SHIFT + RIGHT or LEFT
keys to extend the selection while multiple selections are made.
- **Line comments** up to 15 characters long can be specified now (used to be
up to 3 characters long).
- The color of **Bookmarked lines** can be specified now.
- The **current line color** is now kept even while a selection is made.
- You can now set a default initial folder for each configuration. When
an **untitled** document is saved, the **Save As** dialog box will be initialized with
the specified initial folder. Notes that if a **known folder** (such as
**Documents**, **Pictures**, etc.) is specified, the Windows system might redirect
the folder location. If the **Sky Drive** integration is set on Windows 8.1, the
**Documents** folder might be redirected to the **Sky Drive Documents** folder.

- The **Bookmarked Lines** item was added to the **Specified Part** list box in the **Display** tab of
**Configuration Properties**.
- The " **Do not show this message again**" check box was
added to the Access Denied dialog box to skip this prompt message. This
dialog box is displayed when EmEditor tries to save a file in the Program
Files or Windows system folder. This setting will be not be remember between
EmEditor sessions, so the prompt message will show up again after you
restart EmEditor.

dialog box.](../dlg/properties/file/new_details/index)
