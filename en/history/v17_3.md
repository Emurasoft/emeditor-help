# Version 17.3

December 13, 2017

## New General Features

- In theCSV Cell Selection Mode, dragging a border of the selected cell(s) moves or copies the selection. When entire columns or line(s) are selected, dropping with the SHIFT key reorders the columns or line(s).
- Numbers (such as line numbers and columns) in theStatus Bar are displayed as 3-digit separated numbers (depending on theRegion and Language settings on Windows).
- TheOnigmo version was updated to v6.1.3. Regular expression new features such asAbsent Operator are available.
- Changed the font size in dialog boxes from 8 point to 9 point.
- Greatly improved the speed of editing when many cells were selected and the ENTER key was pressed.
- The behavior was adjusted when double-clicking theAutoFill handle. If the cell immediately below the selection is empty, the AutoFill action will stop at the next non-empty cell. However, if the AutoFill handle is double-clicked while the SHIFT key is pressed, and if only one row is selected, the AutoFill action will be repeated with the new value on a non-empty cell until the last row. The new version will simply copy the same value rather than serial numbers even if the current cell contains a number when only one row is selected.
- The new version allows CTRL + A to select all in theCell toolbar.
