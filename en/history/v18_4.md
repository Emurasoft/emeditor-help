# Version 18.4

December 18, 2018

## New General Features

- Added the ability to find, replace, find in files, replace in files, and filter with a [number range expression](../howto/search/number_range_syntax). To use a number range inFind,Replace,Find in Files,Replace in Files, orAdvanced Filter dialog box, selectNumber Range from theMode drop-down list box. To use a number range inFind,
Replace,FindInFiles,ReplaceInFiles, orFilter macros, include theeeExFindNumberRange flag in theExFlags parameter.
The number range is expressed in interval notation. For instance,

| Number Range | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| \[1 , 9\] | matches integers 1, 2, 3, ..., 9 |
| \[ , 9) | matches any integers less than 9. |
| \[1.0 , 9.0) | matches decimal numbers greater than or equal to 1.0, and less than 9.0. |
| \[ , 1.0) | matches any decimal numbers less than 1.0 |
| (2.0 , \] | matches any decimal number greater than 2.0 |

- Added the ability to use JavaScript as a [replacement expression](../howto/search/replacement_expression_syntax) when using regular expression or number range to replace. For converting replace expressions, EmEditor uses Chakra (JScript v11) for improved speed. Because this engine is separate from the macro environment, which uses the old JScript v5.8 engine, various objects used for macros are not available for replace expressions. Examples of replacement expressions include:

| Replacement Expression | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| \\J "\\0" + "abc" | appends "abc" at the end of the matched string |
| \\J "\\0".substr( 0, 5 ); | returns the first 5 characters of the matched string |
| \\J \\0 \* 100; | multiply a matched number with 100 |
| \\J parseFloat( \\0 ).toFixed(2); | rounds a matched number to 2 decimal places |
| \\J cell( -1 ) | returns the text in the left neighbor cell, relative to the matched cell. |
| \\J parseFloat( cell( -1 ) ) + parseFloat( cell( -2 ) ) | returns the sum of the two neighboring cells on the left |

- Improved the speed while editing a document containing very long lines.
- Improved the speed when many regular expression highlight keywords or markers are defined.
- Added the/xnr option to the [command line options](../howto/file/file_commandline).

## New Options

- Added the [Optimization page](../dlg/customize/optimization/index) to theCustomize dialog box.

- Added theUse Number Range button to theFind andFilter toolbars.

## Macro New Features

- AddedeeExFindNumberRange to theExFlags parameter of the [Filter method](../macro/document/filter) of theDocument object, the[Find](../macro/selection/selection_find) and[Replace](../macro/selection/selection_replace) methods of theSelection object, and the[FindInFiles](../macro/editor/editor_findinfiles) and[ReplaceInFiles](../macro/editor/editor_replaceinfiles) methods of theEditor object.
