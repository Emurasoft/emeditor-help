# Version 14.6

October 21, 2014

## New General Features

- The new version allows you to define up to 8 separate value formats, and each format now allows up to 39 character long text. You can specify each format whether to allow delimiters in double
quotes, whether to allow newline characters in double quotes, and the number of lines in the **column headings**.
- The **CSV/Sort** toolbar was added and CSV related features were greatly enhanced.
- The **CSV/Sort** toolbar allows you to change the **CSV mode**, **CSV conversion**, **Fixed Width Columns**, various column/separator related commands, sort commands, the
**Delete Duplicate Lines** command, **Line**
**Number**, **Ruler**, and **Heading** commands.
- Following commands can be executed against all documents in the current group by clicking the button while pressing the SHIFT key — **Normal Mode**, all CSV commands, all
**Convert to** commands,
**Fixed Width Columns**, all sort commands, **Delete Duplicate Lines**, **Heading 0 – 4**, **Adjust Separator Positions**, **Automatically Add Separators**, and
**Remove All Separators**.
- The **Sort by Multiple Columns** command was added.
- The new **Filter** Bar was added. The **Filter** Bar allows you to view only the lines that include a specified string.
- The **Extract All** button was added to the [**Find** dialog box](../dlg/find/index). Pressing the **Extract All** button extracts lines containing the searched string to a new document.
- Double-clicking on the ruler now selects the column except the headings. Triple-clicking the ruler selects the entire column. After double/triple-clicking, moving the mouse right or left while
pressing the mouse button selects multiple columns.
- Double-clicking the ruler will not adjust columns anymore.
- The Updater feature which was temporarily disabled on v14.5.4 was restored. The new Updater installs only digitally signed update packages signed with the same certificate as the Updater.

## New Options

- The [**CSV** page](../dlg/customize/csv/index) was added to the **Customize** dialog box.
- The **CSV files to Detect** list box was added to the [**File** page](../dlg/properties/file/index) of configuration properties (The **Detect CSV**, **Detect TSV**,
and **Detect DSV** check boxes were deprecated). The **Delimiter** text box was moved to the [**CSV** page](../dlg/customize/csv/index) of the **Customize** dialog box.
- The **In the Selection Only** check box was added to the [**Find** dialog box](../dlg/find/index).
- The **Headings**, **Search Range**, and **Filter** items were added to the list in the [**Display** page](../dlg/properties/display/index) of configuration properties.
