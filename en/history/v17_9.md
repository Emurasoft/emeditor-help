# Version 17.9

July 11, 2018

## New General Features

- Unicode code point information is added to the character code at cursor status bar item.
- Associated more file types to EmEditor, and designed new document icons (Store App versions only).
- Included Help files (English, Japanese, and Chinese) to the packages (Store App versions only).

## New Options

- Added the **To New CSV Column** option (by clicking the ▼ button on the right of the **Extract** button) in the [**Replace** dialog box](../dlg/replace/index). While columns are selected in a CSV document, selecting the **To New CSV Column** option in the context menu displayed when the ▼ button on the right side of the **Extract** button, and click the **Extract** button will create a
new CSV column filled with the replaced strings, while the original column remains unchanged. The new column is inserted just to the right of the original.
- Added the [**Use Escape Character** check box](../dlg/customize/csv/index) to the **CSV** page of the **Customize** dialog box. CSV documents usually quote delimiters with double-quotes, however, some nonstandard CSV data escape delimiters with backslashes. The new option allows you to edit such nonstandard CSV data.

## New Commands

- [Duplicate Columns](../cmd/edit/duplicate_column)

## Plug-in New Features

- Added the **Complete (Keep Typed Case)** command to the [**Word Complete** plug-in](../howto/plugin/plugin_wordcomplete), and assigned Shift+Enter as the default shortcut key.

## Plug-in API New Features

- Added the **EI\_GET\_BOOKMARK\_COUNT** command to the [**EE\_INFO** message](../plugin/message/ee_info).

## Macro New Features

- Added **eeFindExtract** and **eeFindOutput** flags to the nFlags parameter, and added **eeExFindInsertColumn** flags to the nExFlags parameter of the [**Replace** method](../macro/selection/selection_replace) of the **Selection** object.
- Added the [**BookmarkCount** property](../macro/document/bookmark_count) to the **Document** object.
