# Fuzzy Matching Options dialog box

This dialog box appears when the
**...** button is clicked in the **Find**, **Replace**, **Find in Files**, **Replace in Files**, **Advanced Filter**, or **Join CSV** dialog box.

## Similarity slider

Specifies the similarity in percentage. For instance, if you specify 75%, and if the search string is 4 characters long, 3 out of 4 characters must be equal in order to match. You may set this 100% if any of the following options is set. For instance, if you only want to ignore diacritics, you should set this 100% and set the **Ignore nonspacing combining characters, such as diacritics, dakuten, and handakuten** check box.

## Max edit distance
