# Clipboard page

The **Clipboard** page allows you to customize settings related to clipboard
operations.

## Show Clipboard History on Paste check box

If this is checked, EmEditor will show **Show Clipboard History** button when the **[Paste](../../../cmd/edit/edit_paste)** command was selected. Clicking this button or selecting the **Show Clipboard History** (default shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+V) command displays the **Clipboard History** listbox, which allows you to quickly select a previously used Clipboard text.

## Monitor the Clipboard copied on External Applications check box

## Move recently used string to top in the Clipboard History check box
