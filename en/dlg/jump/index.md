# Jump dialog box

This dialog box appears when the [**Jump** \
command](../../cmd/edit/jump) is selected.Â You can specify a line number to which you would like to
jump.

### Line text box

Line number to which you would like to jump.

### Column text box

Column number to which you would like to jump. In case of a CSV document, this number represents the column relative to the left side of the specified CSV column.

### Logical Coordinates check box

Count line numbers as [logical \
coordinates](../../glossary/logicalcoordinates).

### CSV Column drop-down list box

CSV Column number to which you would like to jump in case of a CSV document.

### File Position text box

Specify the file position to which you would like to jump. Changing the **File Position** will update the **Line** and **Column** in the dialog box before you confirm the jump, and vice versa.
