# Advanced Open dialog box

This dialog box appears when the [**Advanced Open** command](../../cmd/file/advanced_open) is selected. You can split a file with newlines at every specified number of bytes, and run a macro against each opened document while opening multiple files.

## Insert newlines at every specified number of bytes check box

If this box is checked, EmEditor will insert a newline at every specified number of bytes while opening file(s). This feature is useful when you want to open fixed-length record data file and when you know the length of each record.

## Ensure a newline exists at the end of each file check box

If this box is checked, EmEditor will check if a newline exists at the end of each open file, and append a newline to the open document if it does not exist.

## Run a macro against each opened document check box

If this box is checked, you can specify a macro to run against each open document while opening multiple files.

## Select Files to Open button

Click this button to display the **Open** dialog box where you can select the file(s) you want to open in EmEditor.

## Set this as the default macro check box

If this box is checked, you can set the selected macro as the default macro.
