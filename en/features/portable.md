# Portability Options (Ready for a USB Drive Install)

You have the option to save all settings to INI files instead of the Registry. From the [**Import and Export** Wizard](../dlg/import_export/index) (on the Tools menu), you have the option to export settings to INI files. Once
EmEditor detects INI files in its directory, it does not save the settings to the Registry. The plug-in interface was extended to support the Registry and INI file manipulation.
