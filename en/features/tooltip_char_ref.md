# Tooltip to show HTML/XML character reference

If the mouse cursor hovers over the HTML/XML character references, the actual Unicode characters appear as a tooltip. Moreover, right-clicking on the tooltip allows to you copy the Unicode
characters or convert the document text into the Unicode characters.
