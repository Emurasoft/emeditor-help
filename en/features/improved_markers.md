# Improved Markers

The existing Markers features were also improved. The newAdd
to/Remove from Markers command allows you to quickly add text to or
remove text from the Markers toolbar. TheReplace command was
added to the right-click menu, which allows you to quickly replace the marked
text.

The Auto Marker now optionally works only in alphabets and numbers. Moreover,
a few more options were added to the Options tab of theCustomize
Markers dialog box.
