# Improved Markers

The existing Markers features were also improved. The new **Add**
**to/Remove from Markers** command allows you to quickly add text to or
remove text from the Markers toolbar. The **Replace** command was
added to the right-click menu, which allows you to quickly replace the marked
text.

The Auto Marker now optionally works only in alphabets and numbers. Moreover,
a few more options were added to the Options tab of the **Customize**
**Markers** dialog box.
