# Vertical Selection Editing

The vertical selection editing feature allows you to replace similar lines quickly without using regular expressions.

For instance, you have a file with the following text:

name1

name2

name3

name4

Now you want to capitalize name1 to name4. Click the left of name1, and select all n's vertically while pressing ALT (or press CTRL + SHIFT + F8, and press RIGHT once, and press DOWN four times).

name1

name2

name3

name4

While all four n's are selected, enter N.

Name1

Name2

Name3

Name4

You see all n's have been replaced with N's.
