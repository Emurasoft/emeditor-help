# Quick Start

EmEditor can be loaded without displaying its window at the EmEditor tray icon's startup. This makes the EmEditor window launch much faster. (By default, this feature is disabled. It can be enabled from
**EmEditor Quick Start** check box on the
[**Shortcut** page](../dlg/customize/shortcut/index) of the **Customize** dialog box.)
