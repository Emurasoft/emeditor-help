# Replace in Files

The **Replace in Files** feature is a feature of EmEditor Professional. Just like the **Find in Files** feature, you can use regular expressions to
search for specific words and characters. You can also specify an encoding to
use for the document. To prevent unwanted automated editing, such as inserting
unintended words, EmEditor replaces the words you specify, but leaves the editor
open without saving changes right away. Replaced words are highlighted to assist
in confirming your changes. If you do not wish to keep the changes, they can
easily be removed with the **Undo** command.
