# Optimized Search and Replace

EmEditor always has been optimized for speed. One of the optimizations has been made for the Replace All feature. While Replace All is being executed, a status message box appears and allows you to cancel the Undo information. If you choose to cancel the Undo information, Replace All executes
much faster. If you don't choose to cancel the Undo information, Replace All will save all the Undo information. Along with other improvements, Replace All has become four times faster than it was in EmEditor Professional Version 7.00.
