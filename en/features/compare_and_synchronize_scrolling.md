# New Compare and Synchronize Scrolling features

The new version of EmEditor allows you to compare two recently viewed files with ease. The comparison results are colored within the documents, arranged side by side. The **Diff** plug-in has been deprecated. After comparison, the
**Rescan** command allows you to compare modified documents again with the same conditions. The **Synchronize Scrolling** command scrolls two recently viewed documents synchronously without comparison.
