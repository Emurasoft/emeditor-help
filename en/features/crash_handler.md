# Application Error Handler Support

Should an application error occur in EmEditor, the error handler will let you save modified files before it actually terminates. Should an application error occur inside a plug-in, EmEditor
will allow you to disable the plug-in without terminating.

(New feature in EmEditor Professional/Standard 5.0)
