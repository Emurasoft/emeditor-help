# Multiple File Encoding Conversion

The new version allows you to convert the encodings of many files at the same time. To do this, first open all files that you want to convert with EmEditor, either by pressing CTRL+O to open the Open dialog and selecting multiple files, or by specifying "emeditor.exe \*.\*", for example, in the Command Prompt window. Then selecting **[Save All with Encoding](../dlg/save_all_as/index)** on the File menu will allow you to save all documents with a specified encoding.
