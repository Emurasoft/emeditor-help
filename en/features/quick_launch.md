# Quick Launch

The new **[Quick Launch](../cmd/tools/search_all_commands)** command allows you to open a dialog box where you can type a partial keyword to search all the commands available in EmEditor. A list box is quickly filled with searched commands, and then you can select which list item you want to launch. The **Quick Launch**
window will search all EmEditor commands, plug-ins, macros, external tools,
recently used files, folders, fonts, opened document file names, and much more.
