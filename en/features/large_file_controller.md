# Large File Controller

EmEditor is able to open files larger than 16 TB by opening a portion of the file with the custom bar - Large File Controller. The Large File Controller allows you to specify the beginning point, end point, and range of the file to be opened. It also allows you to stop the opening of the
file and monitor the real size of the file and the size of the temporary disk available.
