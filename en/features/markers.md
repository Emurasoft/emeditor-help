# Markers

EmEditor currently allows users to set highlight strings. However, in previous versions, there were several limitations, such as the inconvenience of adding highlight strings temporarily, that have
been rectified in the new version.

The new marker feature allows you to specify strings to highlight temporarily. In the context menu displayed by right-clicking, selectingAdd to Markers allows you to add the selected
text or the word at the cursor position to the list of markers. The list of markers is displayed in the newMarkers toolbar. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the selected text to
theMarkers toolbar to add the text to the list of markers.

Right clicking on each marker in theMarkers toolbar displays a context menu, and allows you to enable or disable each marker, search for each marker, or change the match condition
(case sensitivity, only word, regular expressions, etc.).

Each marker can be dragged and dropped to change the order of markers and to insert the marker text into the editor. Selecting theCustomize Markers from the menu allows you to change
the details about the markers. In theMarker List tab, you can change the marker colors, change the marker text, and delete unnecessary markers.

The auto marker is a new feature to automatically select text that is the same as the selected text. TheAuto Marker tab of theCustomize Marker dialog allows you to
specify details about the auto marker, such as retrieving the word at the cursor position, matching the word only, or case sensitivity.
