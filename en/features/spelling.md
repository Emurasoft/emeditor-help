# New Spelling features

The new version of EmEditor allows you to check spelling in various languages
using the **Hunspell library**, already used by many applications
like **OpenOffice** and **Firefox**. As you type,
misspelled words are marked with red wiggly underlining. EmEditor allows you to
correct misspelled words quickly and easily. The new EmEditor installer includes
a U.S. English dictionary. Additional dictionaries are available for download at
the **OpenOffice.org wiki**. Just copy **\*.dic** and
**\*.aff** files into the **Dictionaries**
sub folder of the EmEditor install folder (usually C:\\Program
Files\\EmEditor\\Dictionaries).
