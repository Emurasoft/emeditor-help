# New Spelling features

The new version of EmEditor allows you to check spelling in various languages
using theHunspell library, already used by many applications
likeOpenOffice andFirefox. As you type,
misspelled words are marked with red wiggly underlining. EmEditor allows you to
correct misspelled words quickly and easily. The new EmEditor installer includes
a U.S. English dictionary. Additional dictionaries are available for download at
theOpenOffice.org wiki. Just copy\*.dic and
\*.aff files into theDictionaries
sub folder of the EmEditor install folder (usually C:\\Program
Files\\EmEditor\\Dictionaries).
