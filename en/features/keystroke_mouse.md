# Keystroke and Mouse Operation Recording and Playback

EmEditor can record and play keystrokes and mouse operations against other applications. This capability allows you to automate certain tasks on the Desktop, the browser, or your favorite applications. For developers, this ability can also be
used for testing applications. The [**Window** Object](../macro/window/index) now includes all sorts of properties that can tell almost everything about the window, and the new [**Windows** Collection](../macro/windows/index)
can be used to enumerate top-level windows or child windows for a certain window. The new [**Shell** Object](../macro/shell/index) was added to send keystroke and mouse activities and to enumerate or find top-level windows.
