# Powerful Tab Features

Enhanced tab features are stable since all windows run in a single window in a single process unlike previous versions which only combine windows.

- **Tab** or **Button** style can be selected.
- Close button (Ã—) on the right-side of the tab can be clicked to close the active document.
- Window-grouping is supported, and any tab item can be dragged-and-dropped into another group to join or to create a new group.
- Tab icons and the button width can be customized.
- The command to run when double-clicking the tab or clicking the tab by the middle mouse button can be customized.
- The mouse wheel rotation activates another document.
- The context menu on the tab can be customized.
- The **New tab insert position**, **Which tab should be activated when a tab is closed**, and the **Window to open a new document with** can be customized.
- The tab can be arranged by file names, types, modified times or the recently activated order. The **Auto arrange** can also be specified.
- The tab can be extended to multiple rows or the width can be automatically adjusted when it doesn't fit in the window.
