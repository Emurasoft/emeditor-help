# Custom Bars

**Custom Bars** can be displayed within the EmEditor window. With this feature, useful plug-ins such as **Outlining**, **Web Preview**, and **Search Bar** can be developed. ManyÂ  features were added to support outlining and custom
bars.

EmEditor Professional includes the following plug-ins by default. (The Word Count plug-in does not utilize the custom bar.)

- [Explorer Plug-in](../howto/plugin/plugin_explorer)
- [Open Documents Plug-in](../howto/plugin/plugin_opendocuments)
- [Search Plug-in](../howto/plugin/plugin_search)
- [Snippets Plug-in](../howto/plugin/plugin_snippets)
- [Web Preview Plug-in](../howto/plugin/plugin_webpreview)
- [Word Count Plug-in](../howto/plugin/plugin_wordcount)
