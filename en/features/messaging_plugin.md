# Messaging (Plug-in)

A simple intranet communication feature was added. After selecting short
text, selecting the **Send Selected Text** plug-in on the **Plug-ins** toolbar or menu brings up the **Send To** dialog
box to select computers to send to. Selecting computers or setting the **Send to All Computers** check box will send the selected text to the
specified computer(s). EmEditor must be installed on the destination
computer(s), and the EmEditor tray icon must be running in order to receive
text. When receiving text, a balloon tip will appear. Clicking the balloon tip
or right-clicking on the tray icon and selecting the **Show Last Message**
command will open a new EmEditor window with the received text. There is a limit
in the length of text to send. Please note that on Windows 8, a **Toast**
will appear. The plug-ins is available in the EmEditor library.
