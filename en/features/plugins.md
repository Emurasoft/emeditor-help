# Plug-ins

The functionality of EmEditor has been expanded by incorporating
user-created plug-in support. For example, you can use the Spelling plug-in to check spelling in English text,
and the Decode Unicode plug-in to decode a selected text that is encoded by
HTML/XML Character Reference or Universal Character Names. Plug-ins are written
as Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files, and are stored in the 'plug-ins' folder,
created automatically when EmEditor is installed.Â  See the **[Plug-ins](../plugin/index)** section for more information
about creating your own plug-ins.
