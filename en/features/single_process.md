# Light-Weight, Single-Process, Multi-Threading, and Low Memory Usage

EmEditor runs in one process when multiple files are opened. EmEditor also runs in one process whether using the tab feature or not. Running in one process allows EmEditor to start much faster when multiple files are selected to open, reduce
memory usage, and suppress the task bar blinking when activating other documents. Multiple windows now run as multi-threading. Many plug-in commands and macro methods have been added to navigate multiple documents.

(New feature in EmEditor Professional/Standard Version 5)
