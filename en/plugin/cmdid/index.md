# Command IDs

Command IDs are used by the [EE\_EXEC\_COMMAND message](../message/ee_exec_command), the [Editor\_ExecCommand inline function](../macro/editor_execcommand), the [EE\_QUERY\_STATUS message](../message/ee_query_status), and the [Editor\_QueryStatus inline function](../macro/editor_querystatus).

Command IDs are described in [Command Reference](../../cmd/index).

These constants are defined at the
header file (plugin.h).
