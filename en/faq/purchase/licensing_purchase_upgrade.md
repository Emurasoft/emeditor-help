# Q. When I try to update EmEditor, I see the dialog box that says "You might need to purchase an upgrade." How do I know if I need to purchase an upgrade?

Please go to [**Resend Keys Page**](https://support.emeditor.com/en/sendkeys)
and enter the email address you used to purchase EmEditor. Our system will send a list of all the available keys to you, including the key of the latest version if your license is eligible.

You can also go to the **Help** menu in EmEditor, select the **About EmEditor** command. In the **About EmEditor** dialog box, click the **Extend Maintenance Plan** button and you will be guided to renew your subscription.
