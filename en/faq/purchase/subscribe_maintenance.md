# Q. How do I subscribe to a maintenance/renewal plan?

You will start to receive a few invitation emails from our sales partner, 2Checkout, regarding the subscription process 1 month before your license expiration date. After the expiration date, you will have an additional 1-month grace period to purchase the subscription. Users who want to renew their licenses after the grace period will have to purchase new licenses. If you have any questions regarding the subscription process, please email us at [info@emurasoft.com](mailto:info@emurasoft.com).
