# Q. How can I find out the version number of the currently installed EmEditor and the expiration date of my maintenance plan?

Go to theHelp menu in EmEditor, select
the [About EmEditor command](../../cmd/help/app_about).
The [About EmEditor dialog box](../../dlg/about/index) should then appear.
You can find version information in the upper part of the dialog box. TheÂ type and expiration date of your license can be found in the User Registration Information box.
