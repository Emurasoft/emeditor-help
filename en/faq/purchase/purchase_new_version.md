# Q. If I purchase EmEditor, can I get the newer version for free? Or do I have to pay for the registration fee every time I get a new version?

If you purchase a lifetime license, you will get all the new versions for free.

If you purchase an annual subscription, you will get all the new versions for one year after your purchase date. After one year, you will need to renew your subscription in order to continue using EmEditor.
