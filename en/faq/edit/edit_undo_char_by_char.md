# Q. How can I undo inserted strings character by character using the Undo command?

By default, an entire inserted string will be undone by one **Undo** command. You
can change this behavior by checking the
**Undo**
**Character by Character** check box on the
[**Edit** page](../../dlg/customize/edit/index) of the
[**Customize** dialog box](../../dlg/customize/index). You will then need to restart EmEditor.
