# Q. How do I insert special characters?

SelectAdvanced under theEdit menu, and then selectInsert Special
Character. To inspect a Unicode character code you want to insert, refer to
the
[Latin Extended Characters \
Reference](../../howto/edit/special_char_sample).
You can also inspect a character by using theCharacter Map ( Start menu > All Programs >
Accessories > System Tools > Character Map) if installed in your Windows Operating System. You
might need to adjust the font to display special characters properly.

See also [To Insert Special \
Characters](../../howto/edit/edit_special_char) for the list of keyboard shortcuts.
