# Q. I cannot paste text correctly when the content in the Clipboard has been copied from another application such as Netscape Navigator.

Some other applications, particularly Netscape Navigator, have problems translating text from ANSI to Unicode. Instead of using the regular
**Paste** command, select **All Commands** under the **Tools** menu, then
**Edit > Paste > ANSI Paste**. Alternatively, check **Always Paste as ANSI** on the
**General** page
of the **Current Configuration Properties** dialog box.
