# Q. I cannot paste text correctly when the content in the Clipboard has been copied from another application such as Netscape Navigator.

Some other applications, particularly Netscape Navigator, have problems translating text from ANSI to Unicode. Instead of using the regular
Paste command, selectAll Commands under theTools menu, then
Edit > Paste > ANSI Paste. Alternatively, checkAlways Paste as ANSI on the
General tab
of theCurrent Configuration Properties dialog box.
