# Q. How can I check spelling?

On EmEditor Professional v10 or later, you can check spelling without using any plug-ins. On the Context Menu of EmEditor (the right-click menu), selecting **Check Spelling** will enable spelling. If this menu item is not visible, you can select **Customize Menus** on the Tools menu, select **Context Menu** on the list, and then click the **Reset** button.

Additional dictionaries are available for download at the extensions.OpenOffice.org (http://extensions.openoffice.org/). After download a dictionary, change the file extension from .oxt to .zip, extract the Zip file, and then copy \*.dic and \*.aff files into the Dictionaries sub folder of the EmEditor install folder (usually "%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\EmEditor\\Dictionaries" or "C:\\Program Files\\EmEditor\\Dictionaries").
