# Q. I want to uninstall EmEditor from one computer, and install EmEditor to another computer. How can I transfer settings?

If you want to export your settings from an old computer, and import them into a new computer:

1. On an old computer, select “Import and Export” on the Tools menu, and select “Export all settings into a registry file.” Select App from Windows Settings, and select EmEditor to uninstall.
2. Copy all the exported files and subfolder to a new machine.
3. On a new computer, install EmEditor, select “Import and Export” on the Tools menu, and select “Import all settings from a registry file”.
