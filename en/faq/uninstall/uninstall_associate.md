# Q. I have uninstalled EmEditor. When I double click a file to open the file, my computer looks for EmEditor. Since EmEditor does not exist in my computer anymore, I can't open the file. How do I open such a file?

If you associate files usingAssociate with EmEditor in EmEditor, the original associations are supposed to be restored
after having uninstalled EmEditor.
However, if you associate files yourself in other applications such as Explorer, you need to restore the
original associations yourself. Open Windows Explorer, clickTools, selectFolder Options,
and then click theFile Types tab.
Select extensions you want to delete in theRegistered file types list
box and click theChange button.
In the resultingOpen With dialog box, select a program other than EmEditor that you want to associate the file with.
