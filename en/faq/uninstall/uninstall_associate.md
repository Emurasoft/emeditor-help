# Q. I have uninstalled EmEditor. When I double click a file to open the file, my computer looks for EmEditor. Since EmEditor does not exist in my computer anymore, I can't open the file. How do I open such a file?

If you associate files using **Associate with EmEditor** in EmEditor, the original associations are supposed to be restored
after having uninstalled EmEditor.
However, if you associate files yourself in other applications such as Explorer, you need to restore the
original associations yourself. Open Windows Explorer, click **Tools**, select **Folder Options**,
and then click the **File Types** tab.
Select extensions you want to delete in the **Registered file types** list
box and click the **Change** button.
In the resulting **Open With** dialog box, select a program other than EmEditor that you want to associate the file with.
