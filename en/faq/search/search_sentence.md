# Q. How can I search for a word at the beginning of lines or a word at the end of lines?

The beginning of a line can be represented as "^" and the end of lines can be represented as "$" if you check **Use Regular Expression**
in the **Find** dialog box. Enter "^Search String" in **Find** field if you want to find "Search
String" at
the beginning of lines, or "Search String$" if you want to find "Search
String" at the end of
lines.

A new line can be also represented as "\\n" if you check **Use Escape Sequence**. Enter "\\nSearch String" in **Find** field if you want to find "Search
String" at
the beginning of lines, or "Search String\\n" if you want to find "Search
String" at the end of
lines.
