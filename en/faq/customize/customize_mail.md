# Q. How can my favorite mail software run when clicking mail addresses?

The e-mail program you want to use needs to be the default e-mail software.
You can find an option to set the default e-mail software under Settings >
Control Panel > Internet Options > Programs. If not found, in Explorer, select
Options under theView menu, and select theFile Types
tab. SelectURL:MailTo
Protocol, double-clickopen, and enter the mail software path and options on
Application used to perform action. Refer to the e-mail program help because
the options depend on each mail software. Some e-mail programs do not support this
function.
