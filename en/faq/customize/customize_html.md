# Q. What are "HTML" and "HTML-Embedded" in the Special Syntax combo box on the Highlight (2) page of Properties?

HTML is used when HTML tags specifying the script language (<SCRIPT
type=...>) exist in the HTML document. HTML is also appropriate for ASP files
that include scripts beginning with the % mark. This is usually the case for
VBScript, Javascript, PerlScript, CSS, etc. HTML-Embedded is appropriate when
working with script languages such as PHP or JSP and the characters that
normally mark the beginning of scripts in such languages, which are specified in the
Script Begin box.
