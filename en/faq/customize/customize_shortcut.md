# Q. After updating EmEditor to the newest version, how can I add the new commands to a menu or add the new keyboard shortcuts?

If the new commands do not show up in a menu, selectCustomize Menus
under theTools menu, and click on theReset button to reset the menus to their
defaults. To add new command shortcuts, click on theReset button in the
Keyboard tab ofProperties for All Configurations.
