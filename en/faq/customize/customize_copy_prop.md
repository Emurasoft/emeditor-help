# Q. How can I copy configuration properties on one machine to another?

You can copy them if you write the HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\EmSoft\\EmEditor v3 key to a file with Registry Editor (Regedit.exe), copy the file to the other machine, and read the file with Registry Editor. You might need to change the
folder names in the **Properties** manually.
