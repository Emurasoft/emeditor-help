# Q. I want to specify a new folder to install EmEditor, but it is always installed to C:\\Users\\(Username)\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\EmEditor. Why can't I specify a different folder?

By default, EmEditor is installed as aper-user install. This requires the install path to be in a user-specific folder. We recommend accepting the default install path. However, if you need to change the install path, please select aper-computer install while installing EmEditor, and select theCustom install to specify a folder.
