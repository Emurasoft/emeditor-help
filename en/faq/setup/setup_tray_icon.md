# Q. How can I remove the EmEditor Tray Icon permanently?

Run the EmEditor installation again and make sure the **Add the tray icon on the task bar** check box is unchecked during the setup. This way you will not see the Tray Icon any more. You do not need to uninstall EmEditor before running the
installation again. If this does not work, select **Search** from the Windows Start menu, and search for "emeditor.lnk". This file should be located in the Startup folder. Delete this file to remove the tray icon permanently.
