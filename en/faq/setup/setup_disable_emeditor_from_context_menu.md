# Q. How can I disable EmEditor from the context menu displayed when you right-click on Explorer?

Please clear the " **Add a shortcut to the Context Menu on Explorer**" check box in the " **Shortcut**" page of the **Customize** dialog box. If this option is grayed out because EmEditor was installed per computer, uninstall EmEditor first, then install EmEditor again, but select the CUSTOM install. You will find an option to clear the Context Menu
