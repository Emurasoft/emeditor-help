# Q. How can I open from the same folder in the open dialog?

Select **Customize** under the **Tools** menu, and check the **Remember Last**
**Folder** check box on the **Customize** dialog box.

Alternatively, display the **Properties** for the EmEditor shortcut that
you usually use to run EmEditor, and add /cd in the **Target** text box. For
instance, if the install folder of EmEditor is "C:\\Program Files\\EmEditor",
enter "C:\\Program Files\\EmEditor\\emeditor.exe" /cd. Moreover, fill the **Start in** text box as a folder you want to open from.
