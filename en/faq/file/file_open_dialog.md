# Q. How can I open from the same folder in the open dialog?

SelectCustomize under theTools menu, and check theRemember Last
Folder check box on theCustomize dialog box.

Alternatively, display theProperties for the EmEditor shortcut that
you usually use to run EmEditor, and add /cd in theTarget text box. For
instance, if the install folder of EmEditor is "C:\\Program Files\\EmEditor",
enter "C:\\Program Files\\EmEditor\\emeditor.exe" /cd. Moreover, fill theStart in text box as a folder you want to open from.
