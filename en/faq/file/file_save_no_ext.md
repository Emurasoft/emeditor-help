# Q. When I try saving a file as a file name without an extension, ".txt" will be added automatically. How can I prevent an extension from being added to a file name?

Surrounding the file name with quotation marks ("") will prevent an extension
from being appended.Â  For example, "file" will just be saved as file
instead of file.txt.
