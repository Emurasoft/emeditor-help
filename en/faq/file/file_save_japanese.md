# Q. How can I paste Japanese (or Korean, Chinese, etc.) Word documents into EmEditor and save as text files?

If Windows does not display
Japanese, Korean, or Chinese fonts properly, you will need to go toControl
Panel, selectRegional and Language Options, click theLanguages
tab, and then checkInstall files for East Asian languages.

Open your Word document, select the text
you want to copy, and then press CTRL + C to copy the text to the Clipboard.

Launch a new EmEditor window and press CTRL + V to paste the Clipboard contents to the EmEditor window. You should see the text in Japanese (or Korean,
Chinese, etc.). If you cannot see the text properly, select Japanese (or Korean,
Chinese, etc.) from theFont Category sub menu under theView
menu. If you still cannot see it properly, select the
[Font command](../../cmd/view/font)
under theView menu, and select an appropriate font, for instance,MS
Gothic if it is Japanese.

To save the document, select the [Save As command](../../cmd/file/file_save_as) under theFile
menu, and make sure you select eitherUnicode orUTF-8 from theEncoding drop-down list box. You may also select a locale-specific encoding such as
Japanese (Shift-JIS) if you wish.
