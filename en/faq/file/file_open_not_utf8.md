If an XML file is opened as Unicode, display theCurrent Configuration
Properties, select
the [File page](../../dlg/properties/file/index), and checkOpening
Encoding drop-down list box. If this isUnicode, selectSystem Default. If
Detect
HTML/XML Charset check box is checked, an "encoding=" directive specified within
an XML file is searched, and EmEditor uses the specified encoding if the
directive is found. Note that the encoding specified for opening files is
different from the encoding specified for new files or for saving files.
