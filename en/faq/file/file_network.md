# Q. When using a shared folder on a network, is it possible to prevent other users from making changes to a file that I have open and I am working on?

Yes, it is possible. On the **File** page of **Properties**, select **Keep Locked** from the **Changed by Another Program** combo box.
Other users will still be able to open the file but they will not be able to
save changes to the file until you have closed the file.
