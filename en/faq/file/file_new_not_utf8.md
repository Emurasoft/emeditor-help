# Q. How can I start a new Java file or XML file as Western European, not as UTF-8?

By default, Java files and XML files will start as UTF-8 when the
[**New with Java or XML** \
command](../../cmd/file/file_new_config) is selected. You can change this default behavior by opening the **Configuration Properties**Â  for Java (or XML), selecting the **File** tab, clicking the
**New Files** button, and then selecting **System Encoding** from the
[**Encoding** drop-down list box](../../dlg/properties/file/new_details/index). Note that the encoding specified for
new files is
different from the encoding specified for opening files or for saving files.
