# Q. Where can I download the free version of EmEditor (EmEditor Free)?

EmEditor Free and EmEditor Professional use the same binary program.
You can download EmEditor Free/Professional at the
[**download page**](https://www.emeditor.com/#download).
After you install EmEditor, you can select the "Downgrade" command to downgrade to the Free version.
The Downgrade command can be found by typing "Downgrade" in the Quick Launch window (Ctrl+Q).
Please see the
[**description**](https://www.emeditor.com/text-editor-features/history/emeditor-free/)
how to switch between the Professional version and the Free version.
