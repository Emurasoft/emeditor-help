# Q. How can I display continuous line numbers from page to page? I never had this problem, but now something changed in my configuration.

On the [**General** page](../../dlg/properties/general/index) in the **Current Configuration Properties**
dialog box, uncheck
the **Display Page**
**Number** check box.
