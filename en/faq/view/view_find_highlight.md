# Q. How can I highlight previously searched strings more than once with different colors?

On the [Display page](../../dlg/properties/display/index) in theCurrent Configuration Properties
dialog box, enter how many times you want to
highlight in theSearch Colors edit box. To highlight with different colors,
scroll down to the bottom of theSpecify Part list box, selectSearch string
(1), (2), ..., and click onBackground Color orText Color to select new
colors to display searched strings.
