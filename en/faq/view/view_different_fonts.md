# Q. Different fonts are used when opening different files, or the font used for a new file is different. How can I always use the same font?

Select " **Properties for All Configurations**" on the " **Tools**" menu, select the " **Display**" page, click the " **Font**" button, and the " **Customize Font**" dialog box appears. Click the " **Select All**" button, and click the " **Change**" button in the " **Display Font**" box, and select the font you want to use.
