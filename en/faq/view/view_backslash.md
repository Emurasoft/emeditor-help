# Q. A backslash character is sometimes displayed as a Japanese Yen or Korean Won mark. When I copy a backslash character to the Clipboard, and paste it to a certain web page, it becomes a Japanese Yen or Korean Won mark. Is this a bug?

No. Depending on a font you use, a backslash character (U+005C) can be displayed as a Japanese Yen or Korean Won mark. Please read [Yen and yuan sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yen_and_yuan_sign) for historical reasons.
