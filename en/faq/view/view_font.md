# Q. When do I use Font Category under the View menu?

EmEditor cannot detect a language from Unicode files. You will have to
manually choose aFont Category under theView menu to display a
non-default character set in a Unicode file correctly. When creating a new file
with a language other than default character set, you also need to select theFont Category you want to use.
