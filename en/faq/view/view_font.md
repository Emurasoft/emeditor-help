# Q. When do I use Font Category under the View menu?

EmEditor cannot detect a language from Unicode files. You will have to
manually choose a **Font Category** under the **View** menu to display a
non-default character set in a Unicode file correctly. When creating a new file
with a language other than default character set, you also need to select the **Font Category** you want to use.
