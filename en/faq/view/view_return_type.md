# Q. How can I find the return type (e.g. CR, LF, CR+LF) for each line?

If you set theCharacter Code at Cursor checkbox in theStatus tab of theCustomize dialog box, and when the cursor is at end of any line, you will see0D+0A (CR+LF) or0D (CR only) or0A (LF only). You
can also check theShow CR and LF with Different Marks in theMarks tab of Properties to distinguish the return types. Since each line can have different return types in EmEditor, this is how EmEditor displays the return types for each
line.
