# Q. What are logical coordinates and display coordinates? What is a logical line?

Logical coordinates refer to the coordinates in a document regardless of
the wrap mode in use. Returns due to the wrapping of lines are not counted.
Logical lines refers to the number of lines, discounting lines formed by
wrapping, in a document. Display coordinates, on the other hand, include
wrapped lines in their sum.
