# Q. How can I display URLs without breaking at specific characters (such as , (comma))?

On the [**Link** page](../../dlg/properties/link/index) in
the **Current Configuration Properties** dialog box, add characters you don't want to break
URLs (such as , (comma)) to **Recognize These Characters**.
