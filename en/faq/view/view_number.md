# Q. I display line numbers on the left edge of EmEditor window. When a line is wrapped, I do not want to see the line number incremented within the logical line. How do I configure this behavior?

On the [General page](../../dlg/properties/general/index) in theCurrent Configuration Properties
dialog box, select one of the logical
coordinates options from theLine and Column Display as combo box.
