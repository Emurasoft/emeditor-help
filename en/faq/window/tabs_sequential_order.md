# Q. Is there a way to make EmEditor move through document tabs in sequential order from left to right?

Yes. SelectCustomize on theTools menu, then select the
[Window page](../../dlg/customize/window/index), and clear theSwitch to last used document for Next Document check box. When unchecked, you can switch between the tabbed documents in order from left to right, or right to left, using
CTRL +TAB, or
CTRL +SHIFT +TAB respectively. When checked, pressingCTRL +TAB andCTRL +SHIFT +TAB, switch back and forth between the active document and the last viewed document.
