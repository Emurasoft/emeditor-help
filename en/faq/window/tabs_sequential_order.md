# Q. Is there a way to make EmEditor move through document tabs in sequential order from left to right?

Yes. Select **Customize** on the **Tools** menu, then select the
[**Window** page](../../dlg/customize/window/index), and clear the **Switch to last used document for Next Document** check box. When unchecked, you can switch between the tabbed documents in order from left to right, or right to left, using
**CTRL** + **TAB**, or
**CTRL** + **SHIFT** + **TAB** respectively. When checked, pressing **CTRL** + **TAB** and **CTRL** + **SHIFT** + **TAB**, switch back and forth between the active document and the last viewed document.
