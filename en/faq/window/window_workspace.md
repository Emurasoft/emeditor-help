# Q. How can I save the current positions of all EmEditor windows, and open all the windows at the same positions next time?

Left click the mouse button on the **Tray Icon** to display the **Tray Icon** menu,
and select the [**Save Workspace** command](../../cmd/file/save_workspace)
to save file names and cursor positions of the current workspace. Next time you
can select the [**Restore Workspace** command](../../cmd/file/load_workspace)
to restore the previously saved windows with the same file name and cursor
positions.

You can also use the [**Save Workspace and Close All** command](../../cmd/file/save_workspace_quit_all)
to close all windows after saving the workspace, or use the
[**Save Workspace, Save, and Close All** command](../../cmd/file/save_workspace_exit_all)
to save and close all windows after saving the workspace.
