# Q. Why doesn't the Cascade or Tile command work?

When tabs are enabled, selecting the **Cascade** command or one of the **Tile** commands does not disable the tab. These commands cascade or tile only when multiple groups exist. Therefore, these commands make no sense when only one group exists. This change has been
made due to users' request. To cascade or tile as in previous versions, disable tabs first, then select one of these commands.
**New Horizontal Group** and **New Vertical Group** commands allow you to tile windows even if only one group exists.
