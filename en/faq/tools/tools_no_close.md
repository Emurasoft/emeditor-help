# Q. I want to compile the opened file with an external tool in Command Prompt, but how can I keep the Command Prompt window from closing after the compilation is finished?

Select the [**Customize Tools** command](../../cmd/tools/customize_tools), and select the **New** button and enter "cmd.exe" in the **Command**
text box, and _"_/k "filename" $(Path)" in the **Arguments** text box.
