# Q. How can I report a crash?

If EmEditor crashes, a crash report file will be created usually in the
C:\\ProgramData\\Emurasoft\\EmEditor\\Error\ folder.
Please email the most recent file (compressed to a Zip archive) to
[tech@emurasoft.com](mailto:tech@emurasoft.com) as an attachment
with the detail information including procedure to reproduce your issue.
